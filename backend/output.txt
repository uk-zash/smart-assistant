[Page 6, Line 3]  “When you read the Quran, seek refuge with Allah  from 
[Page 6, Line 4] Satan the outcast. He has no authority over those who 
[Page 6, Line 5] believe and trust in their Lord. His authority is only over 
[Page 6, Line 6] those who follow him, and those who associate others 
[Page 6, Line 7] with Him.”

[Page 12, Line 1] 1.  THE OPENING   (al-Fatihah)  
[Page 12, Line 2] 1. THE OPENING  
[Page 12, Line 3] (al-Fatihah ) 

[Page 12, Line 5] 1. In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer-
[Page 12, Line 6] ciful.  
[Page 12, Line 7] 2. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 12, Line 8] 3. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  
[Page 12, Line 9] 4. Master of the Day of Judgment.  
[Page 12, Line 10] 5. It is You we worship, and upon You we call 
[Page 12, Line 11] for help.  
[Page 12, Line 12] 6. Guide us to the straight path.  
[Page 12, Line 13] 7. The path of those You have blessed, not of 
[Page 12, Line 14] those against whom there is anger, nor of 
[Page 12, Line 15] those who are misguided.  

[Page 12, Line 17] 2. THE HEIFER  
[Page 12, Line 18] (al-Baqarah ) 
[Page 12, Line 19] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 12, Line 20] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 12, Line 21] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 12, Line 22] 2. This is the Book in which there is no doubt, 
[Page 12, Line 23] a guide for the righteous.  
[Page 12, Line 24] 3. Those who believe in the unseen, and pe r-
[Page 12, Line 25] form the prayers, and give from what We 
[Page 12, Line 26] have provided for them.  
[Page 12, Line 27] 4. And those who believe in what was revealed 
[Page 12, Line 28] to you, and in what was revealed before you, 
[Page 12, Line 29] and are certain of the Hereafter.  
[Page 12, Line 30] 5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
[Page 12, Line 31] These are the successf ul. 
[Page 12, Line 32] 6. As for those who disbelieve —it is the same 
[Page 12, Line 33] for them, whether you have warned them, or have not warned them —they do not believe.  
[Page 12, Line 34] 7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on 
[Page 12, Line 35] their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. 
[Page 12, Line 36] They will have a severe to rment.  
[Page 12, Line 37] 8. Among the people are those who say, “We 
[Page 12, Line 38] believe in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they 
[Page 12, Line 39] are not believers.  9. They seek to deceive Allah and those who 
[Page 12, Line 40] believe, but they deceive none but them-
[Page 12, Line 41] selves, though they are not aware.  
[Page 12, Line 42] 10. In their hearts i s sickness, and Allah has in-
[Page 12, Line 43] creased their sickness. They will have a pain-
[Page 12, Line 44] ful punishment because of their denial.  
[Page 12, Line 45] 11. And when it is said to them, “Do not make 
[Page 12, Line 46] trouble on earth,” they say, “We are only re-
[Page 12, Line 47] formers.”  
[Page 12, Line 48] 12. In fact, they are the troublemakers, bu t they 
[Page 12, Line 49] are not aware.  
[Page 12, Line 50] 13. And when it is said to them, “Believe as the 
[Page 12, Line 51] people have believed,” they say, “Shall we be-
[Page 12, Line 52] lieve as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is 
[Page 12, Line 53] they who are the fools, but they do not know.  
[Page 12, Line 54] 14. And when they come across those who be-
[Page 12, Line 55] lieve, they say, “We believe”; but when they 
[Page 12, Line 56] are alone with their devils, they say, “We are with you; we were only ridiculing.”  
[Page 12, Line 57] 15. It is Allah who ridicules them, and leaves 
[Page 12, Line 58] them bewildered in their transgression.  
[Page 12, Line 59] 16. Those are they who have bartered error for 
[Page 12, Line 60] guidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.  
[Page 12, Line 61] 17. Their likeness is that of a person who kin-
[Page 12, Line 62] dled a fire; when it illuminated all around 
[Page 12, Line 63] him, Allah took away their light, and left 
[Page 12, Line 64] them in darkness, unable to see.  
[Page 12, Line 65] 18. Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.  
[Page 12, Line 66] 19. Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which 
[Page 12, Line 67] is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They 
[Page 12, Line 68] press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur-
[Page 12, Line 69] rounds the disbelievers.  
[Page 12, Line 70] 20. The lightning almost snatches their sight 
[Page 12, Line 71] away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they 
[Page 12, Line 72] walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, 
[Page 12, Line 73] they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could 
[Page 12, Line 74] have taken away their hearing and their sight. 
[Page 12, Line 75] Allah is capable of everything.  
[Page 12, Line 76] 21. O people! Worship your Lord who created 
[Page 12, Line 77] you and those before you, that you may attain piety.  
[Page 12, Line 78] 1 
[Page 13, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 13, Line 2] 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, 
[Page 13, Line 3] and the sky a structure, and sends water 
[Page 13, Line 4] down from the sky, and brings out fruits 
[Page 13, Line 5] thereby, as a sustenance for you. T herefore, 
[Page 13, Line 6] do not assign rivals to Allah while you know.  
[Page 13, Line 7] 23. And if you are in doubt about what We 
[Page 13, Line 8] have revealed to Our servant, then produce a 
[Page 13, Line 9] chapter like these, and call your witnesses 
[Page 13, Line 10] apart from Allah, if you are truthful.  
[Page 13, Line 11] 24. But if you do not— and you will not —then 
[Page 13, Line 12] beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.  
[Page 13, Line 13] 25. And give good news to those who believe 
[Page 13, Line 14] and do righteous deeds; that they will have 
[Page 13, Line 15] gardens beneath which rivers flow. When-
[Page 13, Line 16] ever they are provided with fruit t herefrom as 
[Page 13, Line 17] sustenance, they will say, “This is what we 
[Page 13, Line 18] were provided with before,” and they will be 
[Page 13, Line 19] given the like of it. And they will have pure 
[Page 13, Line 20] spouses therein, and they will abide therein 
[Page 13, Line 21] forever.  
[Page 13, Line 22] 26. Allah does not shy away from making an 
[Page 13, Line 23] example of a  gnat, or something above it. As 
[Page 13, Line 24] for those who believe, they know that it is the 
[Page 13, Line 25] Truth from their Lord. But as for those who 
[Page 13, Line 26] disbelieve, they say, “What did Allah intend 
[Page 13, Line 27] by this example?” He leads astray many 
[Page 13, Line 28] thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He 
[Page 13, Line 29] misleads thereby only the evildoers.  
[Page 13, Line 30] 27. Those who violate Allah’s covenant after its 
[Page 13, Line 31] confirmation, and sever what Allah has com-
[Page 13, Line 32] manded to be joined, and commit evil on 
[Page 13, Line 33] earth. These are the losers.  
[Page 13, Line 34] 28. How can you deny Allah, when you were 
[Page 13, Line 35] dead and He gave yo u life, then He will put 
[Page 13, Line 36] you to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?  
[Page 13, Line 37] 29. It is He who created for you everything on 
[Page 13, Line 38] earth, then turned to the heaven, and made 
[Page 13, Line 39] them seven heavens. And He is aware of all 
[Page 13, Line 40] things.  
[Page 13, Line 41] 30. When your Lord said to the angels, “I am 
[Page 13, Line 42] placing a successor on earth.” They said, 
[Page 13, Line 43] “Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we de-
[Page 13, Line 44] clare Your praises and sanctify You?” He 
[Page 13, Line 45] said, “I know what you do not know.”  
[Page 13, Line 46] 31. And He taught Adam the names, all of 
[Page 13, Line 47] them; then he presented them to the angels, 
[Page 13, Line 48] and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you 
[Page 13, Line 49] are sincere.”  
[Page 13, Line 50] 32. They said, “Glory be to You! We have no 
[Page 13, Line 51] knowledge except what You have taught us. 
[Page 13, Line 52] It is you who are the Knowledgeable,  the 
[Page 13, Line 53] Wise.”  
[Page 13, Line 54] 33. He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.” 
[Page 13, Line 55] And when he told them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of 
[Page 13, Line 56] the heavens and the earth, and that I know 
[Page 13, Line 57] what you reveal and what you conceal?”  
[Page 13, Line 58] 34. And We said to the an gels, “Bow down to 
[Page 13, Line 59] Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. 
[Page 13, Line 60] He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the 
[Page 13, Line 61] disbelievers.  
[Page 13, Line 62] 35. We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, 
[Page 13, Line 63] you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as 
[Page 13, Line 64] you please, but do not approach this tree, lest  
[Page 13, Line 65] you become wrongdoers.”  
[Page 13, Line 66] 36. But Satan caused them to slip from it, and 
[Page 13, Line 67] caused them to depart the state they were in. We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of 
[Page 13, Line 68] one another. And you will have residence on 
[Page 13, Line 69] earth, and enjoyment for a while.”  
[Page 13, Line 70] 37. Then Adam rec eived words from his Lord, 
[Page 13, Line 71] so He relented towards him. He is the Relent-ing, the Merciful.  
[Page 13, Line 72] 38. We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet 
[Page 13, Line 73] whenever guidance comes to you from Me, 
[Page 13, Line 74] then whoever follows My guidance —they 
[Page 13, Line 75] have nothing to fear, nor shall they gri eve. 
[Page 13, Line 76] 39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject 
[Page 13, Line 77] Our signs —these are the inmates of the 
[Page 13, Line 78] Fire— wherein they will remain forever.”  
[Page 13, Line 79] 40. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
[Page 13, Line 80] ings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill 
[Page 13, Line 81] your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge 
[Page 13, Line 82] to you, and fear Me.  
[Page 13, Line 83] 41. And believe in what I revealed, confirming 
[Page 13, Line 84] what is with you; and do not be the first to 
[Page 13, Line 85] 2 
[Page 14, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 14, Line 2] deny it; and do not exchange My revelations 
[Page 14, Line 3] for a small price; and be conscious of Me.  
[Page 14, Line 4] 42. And do not mix truth with falsehood, and 
[Page 14, Line 5] do not conceal the truth while you know.  
[Page 14, Line 6] 43. And attend to your prayers, and practice 
[Page 14, Line 7] regular charity, and kneel with those who 
[Page 14, Line 8] kneel.  
[Page 14, Line 9] 44. Do you command people to virtuous con-
[Page 14, Line 10] duct, and forget yourselves, even though you read the Scripture? Do you not under stand? 
[Page 14, Line 11] 45. And seek help through patience and 
[Page 14, Line 12] prayer. But it is difficult, except for the de-
[Page 14, Line 13] vout.  
[Page 14, Line 14] 46. Those who know that they will meet their 
[Page 14, Line 15] Lord, and that to Him they will return.  
[Page 14, Line 16] 47. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor 
[Page 14, Line 17] which I bestowed upon you, and I that fa-
[Page 14, Line 18] vored you over all nations.  
[Page 14, Line 19] 48. And beware of a Day when no soul will 
[Page 14, Line 20] avail another in the least, nor will any inter-cession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any 
[Page 14, Line 21] ransom be taken from it, nor will they be 
[Page 14, Line 22] helped.  
[Page 14, Line 23] 49. And recall that We delive red you from the 
[Page 14, Line 24] people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter-
[Page 14, Line 25] rible persecution, killing your sons and spar-
[Page 14, Line 26] ing your women. Therein was a tremendous 
[Page 14, Line 27] trial from your Lord.  
[Page 14, Line 28] 50. And recall that We parted the sea for you, 
[Page 14, Line 29] so We saved you, and We drowned the peo-ple of Pharaoh as you looked on.  
[Page 14, Line 30] 51. And recall that We appointed for Moses 
[Page 14, Line 31] forty nights. Then you took to worshiping the 
[Page 14, Line 32] calf after him, and you turned wicked.  
[Page 14, Line 33] 52. Then We pardoned you after that, so that 
[Page 14, Line 34] you might be grateful.  
[Page 14, Line 35] 53. And recall that We gave Moses the Scrip-
[Page 14, Line 36] ture and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.  
[Page 14, Line 37] 54. And recall that Moses said to his people, “O 
[Page 14, Line 38] my people, you have done wrong to your-selves by worshiping the calf. So repent to 
[Page 14, Line 39] your Maker, and kill your egos. That would 
[Page 14, Line 40] be better for yo u with your Maker.” So He turned to you in repentance. He is the Ac-
[Page 14, Line 41] cepter of Repentance, the Merciful.  
[Page 14, Line 42] 55. And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will 
[Page 14, Line 43] not believe in you unless we see Allah 
[Page 14, Line 44] plainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck 
[Page 14, Line 45] you, as you looked on.  
[Page 14, Line 46] 56. Then We revived you after your death, so 
[Page 14, Line 47] that you may be appreciative.  
[Page 14, Line 48] 57. And We shaded you with clouds, and We 
[Page 14, Line 49] sent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of 
[Page 14, Line 50] the good things We have provided for you.” 
[Page 14, Line 51] They did not wrong Us, but they used to 
[Page 14, Line 52] wrong their own souls.  
[Page 14, Line 53] 58. And recall that We said, “Enter this town, 
[Page 14, Line 54] and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish; 
[Page 14, Line 55] but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' 
[Page 14, Line 56] We will forgive your sins, and give increase to 
[Page 14, Line 57] the virtuous.”  
[Page 14, Line 58] 59. But the wrongdoers among them substi-
[Page 14, Line 59] tuted words other than those given to them, 
[Page 14, Line 60] so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague 
[Page 14, Line 61] from heaven, because of their wicked behav-
[Page 14, Line 62] ior. 
[Page 14, Line 63] 60. And recall when Moses prayed for water 
[Page 14, Line 64] for his people. We said, “Strike the rock with 
[Page 14, Line 65] your staff.” Thereupon twelve sprin gs gushed 
[Page 14, Line 66] out from it, and each tribe recognized its 
[Page 14, Line 67] drinking -place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s 
[Page 14, Line 68] provision, and do not corrupt the earth with disobedience.”  
[Page 14, Line 69] 61. And recall when you said, “O Moses, we 
[Page 14, Line 70] cannot endure one kind of food, so call to 
[Page 14, Line 71] your Lord to produce for us of what the earth 
[Page 14, Line 72] grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said, 
[Page 14, Line 73] “Would you substitute worse for better? Go 
[Page 14, Line 74] down to Egypt, where you will have what you 
[Page 14, Line 75] asked for.” They were struck with hum ilia-
[Page 14, Line 76] tion and poverty, and incurred wrath from 
[Page 14, Line 77] Allah. That was because they rejected Allah’s 
[Page 14, Line 78] revelations and wrongfully killed the proph-
[Page 14, Line 79] ets. That was because they disobeyed and 
[Page 14, Line 80] transgressed.  
[Page 14, Line 81] 62. Those who believe, and those who are Jew-
[Page 14, Line 82] ish, and the Christian s, and the Sabeans —any 
[Page 14, Line 83] who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
[Page 14, Line 84] 3 
[Page 15, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 15, Line 2] act righteously —will have their reward with 
[Page 15, Line 3] their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will 
[Page 15, Line 4] they grieve.  
[Page 15, Line 5] 63. And recall when We received a pledge 
[Page 15, Line 6] from you, and raised the Mount above you: 
[Page 15, Line 7] “Take what We have given you earnestly, and 
[Page 15, Line 8] remember what is in it, that you may attain 
[Page 15, Line 9] righteousness.”  
[Page 15, Line 10] 64. But after that you turned away. Were it not 
[Page 15, Line 11] for Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you 
[Page 15, Line 12] would have been among the losers.  
[Page 15, Line 13] 65. And you surely knew tho se of you who vi-
[Page 15, Line 14] olated the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be des-
[Page 15, Line 15] picable apes!”  
[Page 15, Line 16] 66. Thus We made it a deterrent for their gen-
[Page 15, Line 17] eration, and for subsequent generations, and a lesson for the righteous.  
[Page 15, Line 18] 67. And recall when Moses said to his people, 
[Page 15, Line 19] “Allah commands you to sacrifice a heifer.” 
[Page 15, Line 20] They said, “Do you make a mockery of us?” 
[Page 15, Line 21] He said, “Allah forbid that I should be so ig-
[Page 15, Line 22] norant.”  
[Page 15, Line 23] 68. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
[Page 15, Line 24] which one.” He said, “He says she is a heifer, 
[Page 15, Line 25] neither too old, nor too young, but in  be-
[Page 15, Line 26] tween. So do what you are commanded.”  
[Page 15, Line 27] 69. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
[Page 15, Line 28] what her color is.” He said, “He says she is a yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the 
[Page 15, Line 29] beholders.”  
[Page 15, Line 30] 70. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us 
[Page 15, Line 31] which one; the  heifers look alike to us; and 
[Page 15, Line 32] Allah willing, we will be guided.” 
[Page 15, Line 33] 71. He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither 
[Page 15, Line 34] yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the 
[Page 15, Line 35] field; sound without blemish.” They said, 
[Page 15, Line 36] “Now you have brought the truth.” So they 
[Page 15, Line 37] slew her; thou gh they almost did not.  
[Page 15, Line 38] 72. And recall when you killed a person, and 
[Page 15, Line 39] disputed in the matter; but Allah was to ex-
[Page 15, Line 40] pose what you were hiding.  
[Page 15, Line 41] 73. We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus 
[Page 15, Line 42] Allah brings the dead to life; and He shows 
[Page 15, Line 43] you His signs, that you may understand.  74. Then after that your hearts hardened. They 
[Page 15, Line 44] were as rocks, or even harder. For there are 
[Page 15, Line 45] some rocks from which rivers gush out, and 
[Page 15, Line 46] others that splinter and water comes out 
[Page 15, Line 47] from them, and others that sink in awe of Al-
[Page 15, Line 48] lah. Allah is not un aware of what you do.  
[Page 15, Line 49] 75. Do you hope that they will believe in you, 
[Page 15, Line 50] when some of them used to hear the Word of 
[Page 15, Line 51] Allah, and then deliberately distort it, even 
[Page 15, Line 52] after understanding it?  
[Page 15, Line 53] 76. And when they come across those who be-
[Page 15, Line 54] lieve, they say, “We believe,” b ut when they 
[Page 15, Line 55] come together privately, they say, “Will you 
[Page 15, Line 56] inform them of what Allah has disclosed to 
[Page 15, Line 57] you, so that they might dispute with you con-
[Page 15, Line 58] cerning it before your Lord?” Do you not un-
[Page 15, Line 59] derstand?  
[Page 15, Line 60] 77. Do they not know that Allah knows what 
[Page 15, Line 61] they conceal and what they reveal?  
[Page 15, Line 62] 78. And among them are uneducated who 
[Page 15, Line 63] know the Scripture only through hearsay, 
[Page 15, Line 64] and they only speculate.  
[Page 15, Line 65] 79. So woe to those who write the Scripture 
[Page 15, Line 66] with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” that they may exchange it for a 
[Page 15, Line 67] little price. Woe to them for what their hands 
[Page 15, Line 68] have written, and woe to them for what they 
[Page 15, Line 69] earn.  
[Page 15, Line 70] 80. And they say, “The Fire will not touch us 
[Page 15, Line 71] except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you 
[Page 15, Line 72] received a promise from Allah —Allah never 
[Page 15, Line 73] breaks His promise —or are you saying about 
[Page 15, Line 74] Allah what you do not know?”  
[Page 15, Line 75] 81. Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and 
[Page 15, Line 76] becomes besieged by his iniquities —these are 
[Page 15, Line 77] the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.  
[Page 15, Line 78] 82. As for those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 15, Line 79] deeds —these are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
[Page 15, Line 80] wherein they will dwell forever.  
[Page 15, Line 81] 83. We made a covenant with the Children of 
[Page 15, Line 82] Israel: “Worship none but Allah; and be good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and the needy; and speak nicely to people; and 
[Page 15, Line 83] pray regularly, a nd give alms.” Then you 
[Page 15, Line 84] 4 
[Page 16, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 16, Line 2] turned away, except for a few of you, recant-
[Page 16, Line 3] ing. 
[Page 16, Line 4] 84. And We made a covenant with you: “You 
[Page 16, Line 5] shall not shed the blood of your own, nor 
[Page 16, Line 6] shall you evict your own from your homes.” 
[Page 16, Line 7] You agreed, and were all witnesses.  
[Page 16, Line 8] 85. But here you are , killing your own, and ex-
[Page 16, Line 9] pelling a group of your own from their 
[Page 16, Line 10] homes —conspiring against them in wrong-
[Page 16, Line 11] doing and hostility. And if they come to you 
[Page 16, Line 12] as captives, you ransom them, although it was 
[Page 16, Line 13] forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part 
[Page 16, Line 14] of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What 
[Page 16, Line 15] is the reward for those among you who do 
[Page 16, Line 16] that but humiliation in this life? And on the 
[Page 16, Line 17] Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to 
[Page 16, Line 18] the most severe torment. Allah is not una-
[Page 16, Line 19] ware of what you do.  
[Page 16, Line 20] 86. Those are they who bou ght the present life 
[Page 16, Line 21] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not 
[Page 16, Line 22] be lightened for them, nor will they be 
[Page 16, Line 23] helped.  
[Page 16, Line 24] 87. We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a 
[Page 16, Line 25] succession of messengers after him. And We 
[Page 16, Line 26] gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and 
[Page 16, Line 27] We suppor ted him with the Holy Spirit. Is it 
[Page 16, Line 28] that whenever a messenger comes to you with 
[Page 16, Line 29] anything your souls do not desire, you grew 
[Page 16, Line 30] arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing 
[Page 16, Line 31] others?  
[Page 16, Line 32] 88. And they said, “Our hearts are sealed.” Ra-
[Page 16, Line 33] ther, Allah has cursed them for their ingrati-
[Page 16, Line 34] tude. They have little faith.  
[Page 16, Line 35] 89. And when a scripture came to them from 
[Page 16, Line 36] Allah, confirming what they have —although 
[Page 16, Line 37] previously they were seeking victory against 
[Page 16, Line 38] those who disbelieved —but when there came 
[Page 16, Line 39] to them what they recognized, they disbe-
[Page 16, Line 40] lieved in it. So Allah’s curse is upon the dis-
[Page 16, Line 41] believers.  
[Page 16, Line 42] 90. Miserable is what they sold their souls 
[Page 16, Line 43] for—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of 
[Page 16, Line 44] resentment that Allah would send down His 
[Page 16, Line 45] grace upon whomever He chooses from 
[Page 16, Line 46] among His servants. Thus they incurred 
[Page 16, Line 47] wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning 
[Page 16, Line 48] punishment for the disbelievers.  91. And when it is said to them, “Believe in 
[Page 16, Line 49] what Allah has revealed,” they say, “We be-
[Page 16, Line 50] lieve in what was revealed to us,” and they re-
[Page 16, Line 51] ject anything beyond that, although it is the 
[Page 16, Line 52] truth which confirms what they have. Say, 
[Page 16, Line 53] “Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if 
[Page 16, Line 54] you were believers?”  
[Page 16, Line 55] 92. Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet 
[Page 16, Line 56] you adopted the calf in his absence, and you 
[Page 16, Line 57] were in the wrong.  
[Page 16, Line 58] 93. And We made a covenant with  you, and 
[Page 16, Line 59] raised the Mount above you: “Take what We have given you firmly, and listen.” They said, 
[Page 16, Line 60] “We hear and disobey.” And their hearts be-
[Page 16, Line 61] came filled with the love of the calf because of 
[Page 16, Line 62] their disbelief. Say, “Wretched is what your 
[Page 16, Line 63] faith commands you to  do, if you are believ-
[Page 16, Line 64] ers.”  
[Page 16, Line 65] 94. Say, “If the Final Home with Allah is yours 
[Page 16, Line 66] alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.”  
[Page 16, Line 67] 95. But they will never wish for it, because of 
[Page 16, Line 68] what their hands have forwarded. Allah is 
[Page 16, Line 69] aware of the evildoers.  
[Page 16, Line 70] 96. You will find them, of all mankind, the 
[Page 16, Line 71] most eager for life, even more than the poly-
[Page 16, Line 72] theists. Every one of them wishes he could 
[Page 16, Line 73] live a thousand years; but to be granted a long 
[Page 16, Line 74] life will not nudge him from the punishment. 
[Page 16, Line 75] Allah is Se eing of what they do.  
[Page 16, Line 76] 97. Say, “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel —it is 
[Page 16, Line 77] he who revealed it to your heart by Allah’s 
[Page 16, Line 78] leave, confirming what preceded it, and guid-
[Page 16, Line 79] ance and good news for the believers.”  
[Page 16, Line 80] 98. Whoever is hostile to Allah, and His angels, 
[Page 16, Line 81] and His mess engers, and Gabriel, and Mi-
[Page 16, Line 82] chael —Allah is hostile to the faithless.  
[Page 16, Line 83] 99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and 
[Page 16, Line 84] none rejects them except the sinners.  
[Page 16, Line 85] 100. Is it not that whenever they make a cove-
[Page 16, Line 86] nant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most 
[Page 16, Line 87] of them do n ot believe.  
[Page 16, Line 88] 101. And when there came to them a messen-
[Page 16, Line 89] ger from Allah, confirming what they had, a faction of those who were given the Book 
[Page 16, Line 90] 5 
[Page 17, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 17, Line 2] threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, 
[Page 17, Line 3] as if they do not know.  
[Page 17, Line 4] 102. And they followed what the devils taught 
[Page 17, Line 5] during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solo-
[Page 17, Line 6] mon who disbelieved, but it was the devils 
[Page 17, Line 7] who disbelieved. They taught the people 
[Page 17, Line 8] witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon 
[Page 17, Line 9] to the two angels Harut and Marut. They did not teach anybody until they had said, “W e 
[Page 17, Line 10] are a test, so do not lose faith.” But they learned from them the means to cause sepa-
[Page 17, Line 11] ration between man and his wife. But they 
[Page 17, Line 12] cannot harm anyone except with Allah's per-
[Page 17, Line 13] mission. And they learned what would harm 
[Page 17, Line 14] them and not benefit them. Yet they knew 
[Page 17, Line 15] that whoever deals in it will have no share in 
[Page 17, Line 16] the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold 
[Page 17, Line 17] their souls for, if they only knew.  
[Page 17, Line 18] 103. Had they believed and been righteous, the 
[Page 17, Line 19] reward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew.  
[Page 17, Line 20] 104. O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous 
[Page 17, Line 21] words, but say words of respect, and listen. 
[Page 17, Line 22] The disbelievers will have a painful torment.  
[Page 17, Line 23] 105. It is never the wish of the disbelievers from 
[Page 17, Line 24] among the People of the Book, nor of the pol-ytheists, that any good should be sent down 
[Page 17, Line 25] to yo u from your Lord. But Allah chooses for 
[Page 17, Line 26] His mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Pos-
[Page 17, Line 27] sessor of Sublime Grace.  
[Page 17, Line 28] 106. We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be 
[Page 17, Line 29] forgotten, unless We bring one better than it, 
[Page 17, Line 30] or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah 
[Page 17, Line 31] is capab le of all things?  
[Page 17, Line 32] 107. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the 
[Page 17, Line 33] sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and 
[Page 17, Line 34] that apart from Allah you have no guardian 
[Page 17, Line 35] or helper?  
[Page 17, Line 36] 108. Or do you want to question your Messen-
[Page 17, Line 37] ger as Moses was questioned before? Who-
[Page 17, Line 38] ever exch anges faith for disbelief has strayed 
[Page 17, Line 39] from the right path.  
[Page 17, Line 40] 109. Many of the People of the Book wish to 
[Page 17, Line 41] turn you back into unbelievers after you have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear to them. But pardon and overlook, unt il Allah brings His com-
[Page 17, Line 42] mand. Allah has power over all things.  
[Page 17, Line 43] 110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. 
[Page 17, Line 44] Whatever good you forward for yourselves, 
[Page 17, Line 45] you will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of 
[Page 17, Line 46] everything you do.  
[Page 17, Line 47] 111. And they say, “None will enter Heave n un-
[Page 17, Line 48] less he is a Jew or a Christian.” These are their 
[Page 17, Line 49] wishes. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are 
[Page 17, Line 50] truthful.”  
[Page 17, Line 51] 112. In fact, whoever submits himself to Allah, 
[Page 17, Line 52] and is a doer of good, will have his reward 
[Page 17, Line 53] with his Lord —they have nothing to fear, nor 
[Page 17, Line 54] shall the y grieve.  
[Page 17, Line 55] 113. The Jews say, “The Christians are not 
[Page 17, Line 56] based on anything;” and the Christians say, “The Jews are not based on anything.” Yet they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ig-
[Page 17, Line 57] norant said the same thing. Allah will judge 
[Page 17, Line 58] between them on the Day o f Resurrection re-
[Page 17, Line 59] garding their differences.  
[Page 17, Line 60] 114. Who is more unjust than him who forbids 
[Page 17, Line 61] the remembrance of Allah’s name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? These ought not to enter them except in fear. For 
[Page 17, Line 62] them is disgrace in this world, and for them 
[Page 17, Line 63] is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.  
[Page 17, Line 64] 115. To Allah belong the East and the West. 
[Page 17, Line 65] Whichever way you turn, there is Allah’s 
[Page 17, Line 66] presence. Allah is Omnipresent and Omnis-
[Page 17, Line 67] cient.  
[Page 17, Line 68] 116. And they say, “Allah has begotten a son.” 
[Page 17, Line 69] Be He glorified. Rath er, His is everything in 
[Page 17, Line 70] the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.  
[Page 17, Line 71] 117. Originator of the heavens and the earth. 
[Page 17, Line 72] Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, 
[Page 17, Line 73] “Be,” and it becomes.  
[Page 17, Line 74] 118. Those who do not know say, “If only Allah 
[Page 17, Line 75] would speak to us, or a sign would come to us.” Thus said those who were before them. 
[Page 17, Line 76] Their hearts are alike. We have made the 
[Page 17, Line 77] signs clear for people who are certain.  
[Page 17, Line 78] 6 
[Page 18, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 18, Line 2] 119. We have sent you with the truth— bring-
[Page 18, Line 3] ing good news, and giving warnings. You will 
[Page 18, Line 4] not be questioned abo ut the inmates of Hell.  
[Page 18, Line 5] 120. The Jews and the Christians will not ap-
[Page 18, Line 6] prove of you, unless you follow their creed. 
[Page 18, Line 7] Say, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.” 
[Page 18, Line 8] Should you follow their desires, after the 
[Page 18, Line 9] knowledge that has come to you, you will 
[Page 18, Line 10] have in Allah neit her guardian nor helper.  
[Page 18, Line 11] 121. Those to whom We have given the Scrip-
[Page 18, Line 12] ture follow it, as it ought to be followed —
[Page 18, Line 13] these believe in it. But as for those who reject 
[Page 18, Line 14] it—these are the losers.  
[Page 18, Line 15] 122. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
[Page 18, Line 16] ing which I bestowed upon you, and that I have favored you over all people.  
[Page 18, Line 17] 123. And beware of a Day when no soul will 
[Page 18, Line 18] avail another soul in any way, and no ransom 
[Page 18, Line 19] will be accepted from it, and no intercession 
[Page 18, Line 20] will benefit it, and they will not be helped.  
[Page 18, Line 21] 124. And when his Lord teste d Abraham with 
[Page 18, Line 22] certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, 
[Page 18, Line 23] “I am making you a leader of humanity.” He 
[Page 18, Line 24] said, “And my descendants?” He said, “My 
[Page 18, Line 25] pledge does not include the wrongdoers.”  
[Page 18, Line 26] 125. And We made the House a focal point for 
[Page 18, Line 27] the people, and a sanctu ary. Use the shrine of 
[Page 18, Line 28] Abraham as a place of prayer. And We com-
[Page 18, Line 29] missioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify 
[Page 18, Line 30] My House for those who circle around it, and 
[Page 18, Line 31] those who seclude themselves in it, and those 
[Page 18, Line 32] who kneel and prostrate.”  
[Page 18, Line 33] 126. When Abraham said, “O My Lord,  make 
[Page 18, Line 34] this a peaceful land, and provide its people 
[Page 18, Line 35] with fruits —whoever of them believes in Al-
[Page 18, Line 36] lah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever 
[Page 18, Line 37] disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, 
[Page 18, Line 38] then I will consign him to the punishment of 
[Page 18, Line 39] the Fire; how miserable the destiny!”  
[Page 18, Line 40] 127. As Abraham raises the foundations of the 
[Page 18, Line 41] House, together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, ac-
[Page 18, Line 42] cept it from us, You are the Hearer, the 
[Page 18, Line 43] Knower.  
[Page 18, Line 44] 128. Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, 
[Page 18, Line 45] and from our descendants a community sub-
[Page 18, Line 46] missive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor 
[Page 18, Line 47] of Repentance, the Merciful.  
[Page 18, Line 48] 129. Our Lord, and raise up among them a 
[Page 18, Line 49] messenger, of themselves, who will recite to 
[Page 18, Line 50] them Your revelations, and teach them the 
[Page 18, Line 51] Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Almighty, the Wise.”  
[Page 18, Line 52] 130. Who would forsake the religion of Abra-
[Page 18, Line 53] ham, except he who fools himself? We chose 
[Page 18, Line 54] him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will 
[Page 18, Line 55] be among the righteous.  
[Page 18, Line 56] 131. When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He 
[Page 18, Line 57] said, “I have  submitted to the Lord of the 
[Page 18, Line 58] Worlds.”  
[Page 18, Line 59] 132. And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Ja-
[Page 18, Line 60] cob, “O my sons, Allah has chosen this reli-gion for you, so do not die unless you have 
[Page 18, Line 61] submitted.”  
[Page 18, Line 62] 133. Or were you witnesses when death ap-
[Page 18, Line 63] proached Jacob, and he said to his s ons, 
[Page 18, Line 64] “What will you worship after Me?” They said, 
[Page 18, Line 65] “We will worship your God, and the God of 
[Page 18, Line 66] your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; 
[Page 18, Line 67] One God; and to Him we submit.”  
[Page 18, Line 68] 134. That was a community that has passed; for 
[Page 18, Line 69] them is what they have earned, and for you  is 
[Page 18, Line 70] what you have earned; and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.  
[Page 18, Line 71] 135. And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, and 
[Page 18, Line 72] you will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion 
[Page 18, Line 73] of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an 
[Page 18, Line 74] idolater.”  
[Page 18, Line 75] 136. Say, “We believe i n Allah; and in what was 
[Page 18, Line 76] revealed to us; and in what was revealed to 
[Page 18, Line 77] Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
[Page 18, Line 78] and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to 
[Page 18, Line 79] Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the 
[Page 18, Line 80] prophets —from their Lord. We make no dis-
[Page 18, Line 81] tinction bet ween any of them, and to Him we 
[Page 18, Line 82] surrender.”  
[Page 18, Line 83] 137. If they believe in the same as you have be-
[Page 18, Line 84] lieved in, then they have been guided. But if 
[Page 18, Line 85] they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah will protect you against them; for He is the 
[Page 18, Line 86] Hearer, the Knower.  
[Page 18, Line 87] 7 
[Page 19, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 19, Line 2] 138. Allah’s coloring. And who gives better col-
[Page 19, Line 3] oring than Allah? “And we are devoted to 
[Page 19, Line 4] Him.”  
[Page 19, Line 5] 139. Say, “Do you argue with us about Allah, 
[Page 19, Line 6] when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We 
[Page 19, Line 7] have our works, and you have your works, 
[Page 19, Line 8] and we are sincere to Him?”  
[Page 19, Line 9] 140. Or do y ou say that Abraham, Ishmael, 
[Page 19, Line 10] Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or 
[Page 19, Line 11] Christians? Say, “Do you know better, or Al-
[Page 19, Line 12] lah?” And who does greater wrong than he 
[Page 19, Line 13] who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? 
[Page 19, Line 14] Allah is not unaware of what you do.  
[Page 19, Line 15] 141. That was a community that has passed. To 
[Page 19, Line 16] them is what they have earned, and to you is 
[Page 19, Line 17] what you have earned. And you will not be 
[Page 19, Line 18] questioned about what they used to do.  
[Page 19, Line 19] 142. The ignorant among the people will say, 
[Page 19, Line 20] “What has turned them away from the direc-
[Page 19, Line 21] tion of praye r they once followed?” Say, “To 
[Page 19, Line 22] Allah belong the East and the West. He 
[Page 19, Line 23] guides whom He wills to a straight path.”  
[Page 19, Line 24] 143. Thus We made you a moderate commu-
[Page 19, Line 25] nity, that you may be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger may be a witness to 
[Page 19, Line 26] you. We only esta blished the direction of 
[Page 19, Line 27] prayer, which you once followed, that We 
[Page 19, Line 28] may distinguish those who follow the Mes-
[Page 19, Line 29] senger from those who turn on their heels. It 
[Page 19, Line 30] is indeed difficult, except for those whom Al-
[Page 19, Line 31] lah has guided. But Allah would never let 
[Page 19, Line 32] your faith go to waste. Allah is Kind towards 
[Page 19, Line 33] the people, Merciful.  
[Page 19, Line 34] 144. We have seen your face turned towards 
[Page 19, Line 35] the heaven. So We will turn you towards a di-
[Page 19, Line 36] rection that will satisfy you. So turn your face 
[Page 19, Line 37] towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever 
[Page 19, Line 38] you may be, turn your faces t owards it. Those 
[Page 19, Line 39] who were given the Book know that it is the Truth from their Lord; and Allah is not una-
[Page 19, Line 40] ware of what they do.  
[Page 19, Line 41] 145. Even if you were to bring to those who 
[Page 19, Line 42] were given the Book every proof, they would 
[Page 19, Line 43] not follow your direction, nor are you to fol-
[Page 19, Line 44] low their direction, nor do they follow the di-
[Page 19, Line 45] rection of one another. And if you were to 
[Page 19, Line 46] follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would be in that case 
[Page 19, Line 47] one of the wrongdoers.  
[Page 19, Line 48] 146. Those to whom We have given the Book 
[Page 19, Line 49] recogniz e it as they recognize their own chil-
[Page 19, Line 50] dren. But some of them conceal the truth 
[Page 19, Line 51] while they know.  
[Page 19, Line 52] 147. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be 
[Page 19, Line 53] a skeptic.  
[Page 19, Line 54] 148. To every community is a direction to-
[Page 19, Line 55] wards which it turns. Therefore, race towards 
[Page 19, Line 56] goodness. Wherever you may be, Allah will 
[Page 19, Line 57] bring you all together. Allah is capable of eve-
[Page 19, Line 58] rything.  
[Page 19, Line 59] 149. And wherever you come from, turn your 
[Page 19, Line 60] face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the 
[Page 19, Line 61] truth from your Lord, and Allah is not heed-
[Page 19, Line 62] less of what you do.  
[Page 19, Line 63] 150. And wherever you c ome from, turn your 
[Page 19, Line 64] face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wher-
[Page 19, Line 65] ever you may be, turn your faces towards it. 
[Page 19, Line 66] So that the people may not have any argu-
[Page 19, Line 67] ment against you —except those who do 
[Page 19, Line 68] wrong among them. So do not fear them, but fear Me, that I may complete My  blessings 
[Page 19, Line 69] upon you, and that you may be guided.  
[Page 19, Line 70] 151. Just as We sent to you a messenger from 
[Page 19, Line 71] among you, who recites Our revelations to 
[Page 19, Line 72] you, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.  
[Page 19, Line 73] 152. So remember Me, and I will remember 
[Page 19, Line 74] you. And thank Me, and do not be ungrate-
[Page 19, Line 75] ful. 
[Page 19, Line 76] 153. O you who believe! Seek help through pa-
[Page 19, Line 77] tience and prayers. Allah is with the steadfast.  
[Page 19, Line 78] 154. And do not say of those who are killed in 
[Page 19, Line 79] the cause of Allah, “Dead.” Rather, they are alive,  but you do not perceive.  
[Page 19, Line 80] 155. We will certainly test you with some fear 
[Page 19, Line 81] and hunger, and some loss of possessions and 
[Page 19, Line 82] lives and crops. But give good news to the 
[Page 19, Line 83] steadfast.  
[Page 19, Line 84] 156. Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, 
[Page 19, Line 85] say, “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will return.”  
[Page 19, Line 86] 8 
[Page 20, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 20, Line 2] 157. Upon these are blessings and mercy from 
[Page 20, Line 3] their Lord. These are the guided ones.  
[Page 20, Line 4] 158. Safa and Marwa are among the rites of Al-
[Page 20, Line 5] lah. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the 
[Page 20, Line 6] House, or performs the Umrah, commits no 
[Page 20, Line 7] error by circulating between them. Whoever 
[Page 20, Line 8] volunteers good —Allah is Appreciative and 
[Page 20, Line 9] Cognizant.  
[Page 20, Line 10] 159. Those who suppress the proofs and the 
[Page 20, Line 11] guidance We have revealed, after We have clarified them to humanity in the Scripture —
[Page 20, Line 12] those —Allah curses them, and the cursers 
[Page 20, Line 13] curse them.  
[Page 20, Line 14] 160. Except those who repent, and reform, and 
[Page 20, Line 15] proclaim. Those —I will accept their repent-
[Page 20, Line 16] ance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the 
[Page 20, Line 17] Merciful.  
[Page 20, Line 18] 161. But as for those who reject faith, and die 
[Page 20, Line 19] rejecting —those —upon them is the curse of 
[Page 20, Line 20] Allah, and of the angels,  and of all humanity.  
[Page 20, Line 21] 162. They will remain under it forever, and the 
[Page 20, Line 22] torment will not be lightened for them, and 
[Page 20, Line 23] they will not be reprieved.  
[Page 20, Line 24] 163. Your God is one God. There is no god but 
[Page 20, Line 25] He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.  
[Page 20, Line 26] 164. In the creation of the heavens and the 
[Page 20, Line 27] earth; in the alternation of night and day; in 
[Page 20, Line 28] the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of 
[Page 20, Line 29] mankind; in the water that Allah sends down 
[Page 20, Line 30] from the sky, and revives the earth with it af-
[Page 20, Line 31] ter it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of 
[Page 20, Line 32] creat ures; in the changing of the winds, and 
[Page 20, Line 33] the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who understand.  
[Page 20, Line 34] 165. Yet among the people are those who take 
[Page 20, Line 35] other than Allah as equals to Him. They love 
[Page 20, Line 36] them as the love of Allah. But those w ho be-
[Page 20, Line 37] lieve have greater love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers would realize, when they see the 
[Page 20, Line 38] torment; that all power is Allah’s, and that Al-
[Page 20, Line 39] lah is severe in punishment.  
[Page 20, Line 40] 166. Those who were followed will then disown 
[Page 20, Line 41] those who followed them, and they will  see 
[Page 20, Line 42] the retribution, and ties between them will be severed.  167. Those who followed will say, “If only we 
[Page 20, Line 43] can have another chance, we will disown 
[Page 20, Line 44] them, as they disowned us.” Thus Allah will 
[Page 20, Line 45] show them their deeds, as regrets to them, 
[Page 20, Line 46] and they will not come  out of the Fire.  
[Page 20, Line 47] 168. O people! Eat of what is lawful and good 
[Page 20, Line 48] on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an open enemy.  
[Page 20, Line 49] 169. He commands you to do evil and vice, and 
[Page 20, Line 50] to say about Allah what you do not know.  
[Page 20, Line 51] 170. And when it is said to them, “Follow what 
[Page 20, Line 52] Allah has revealed,” they say, “We will follow 
[Page 20, Line 53] what we found our ancestors following.” Even if their ancestors understood nothing, 
[Page 20, Line 54] and were not guided?  
[Page 20, Line 55] 171. The parable of those who disbelieve is that 
[Page 20, Line 56] of someone who calls upon someone  who 
[Page 20, Line 57] hears nothing except screaming and yelling. 
[Page 20, Line 58] Deaf, dumb, and blind —they do not under-
[Page 20, Line 59] stand.  
[Page 20, Line 60] 172. O you who believe! Eat of the good things 
[Page 20, Line 61] We have provided for you, and give thanks to 
[Page 20, Line 62] Allah, if it is Him that you serve.  
[Page 20, Line 63] 173. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, 
[Page 20, Line 64] and the flesh of swine, and what was dedi-cated to other than Allah. But if anyone is 
[Page 20, Line 65] compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he 
[Page 20, Line 66] commits no sin. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
[Page 20, Line 67] ciful.  
[Page 20, Line 68] 174. Those who conceal what Allah revealed in 
[Page 20, Line 69] the Book, and exchange it for a small price —
[Page 20, Line 70] those swallow nothing but fire into their bel-
[Page 20, Line 71] lies. And Allah will not speak to them on the 
[Page 20, Line 72] Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, 
[Page 20, Line 73] and they will have a painful punishment.  
[Page 20, Line 74] 175. It is they who exchange guidance for error, 
[Page 20, Line 75] and forgiveness for punishment. But why do 
[Page 20, Line 76] they insist on the Fire?  
[Page 20, Line 77] 176. That is because Allah has revealed the 
[Page 20, Line 78] Book in truth; and those who differ about the 
[Page 20, Line 79] Book are in deep discord.  
[Page 20, Line 80] 177. Righteousness does not consist of turning 
[Page 20, Line 81] your faces towards the East  and the West. But 
[Page 20, Line 82] righteous is he who believes in Allah, and the 
[Page 20, Line 83] Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, 
[Page 20, Line 84] 9 
[Page 21, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 21, Line 2] and the prophets. Who gives money, though 
[Page 21, Line 3] dear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the 
[Page 21, Line 4] needy, and the homeless, and the beggars, 
[Page 21, Line 5] and for the fre eing of slaves; those who per-
[Page 21, Line 6] form the prayers, and pay the obligatory 
[Page 21, Line 7] charity, and fulfill their promise when they 
[Page 21, Line 8] promise, and patiently persevere in the face 
[Page 21, Line 9] of persecution, hardship, and in the time of 
[Page 21, Line 10] conflict. These are the sincere; these are the 
[Page 21, Line 11] piou s. 
[Page 21, Line 12] 178. O you who believe! Retaliation for the 
[Page 21, Line 13] murdered is ordained upon you: the free for 
[Page 21, Line 14] the free, the slave for the slave, the female for 
[Page 21, Line 15] the female. But if he is forgiven by his kin, 
[Page 21, Line 16] then grant any reasonable demand, and pay 
[Page 21, Line 17] with good will. This is a c oncession from 
[Page 21, Line 18] your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever com-
[Page 21, Line 19] mits aggression after that, a painful torment 
[Page 21, Line 20] awaits him.  
[Page 21, Line 21] 179. There is life for you in retaliation, O peo-
[Page 21, Line 22] ple of understanding, so that you may refrain.  
[Page 21, Line 23] 180. It is decreed for you: when death ap-
[Page 21, Line 24] proaches  one of you, and he leaves wealth, to 
[Page 21, Line 25] make a testament in favor of the parents and 
[Page 21, Line 26] the relatives, fairly and correctly —a duty 
[Page 21, Line 27] upon the righteous.  
[Page 21, Line 28] 181. But whoever changes it after he has heard 
[Page 21, Line 29] it, the guilt is upon those who change it. Allah 
[Page 21, Line 30] is All -Hearing, All- Knowing.  
[Page 21, Line 31] 182. Should someone suspect bias or injustice 
[Page 21, Line 32] on the part of a testator, and then reconciles 
[Page 21, Line 33] between them, he commits no sin. Allah is 
[Page 21, Line 34] Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 21, Line 35] 183. O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed 
[Page 21, Line 36] for you, as it was prescribed for those before 
[Page 21, Line 37] you, that you may become righteous.  
[Page 21, Line 38] 184. For a specified number of days. But who-
[Page 21, Line 39] ever among you is sick, or on a journey, then a number of other days. For those who are 
[Page 21, Line 40] able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. But 
[Page 21, Line 41] whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for 
[Page 21, Line 42] him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.  
[Page 21, Line 43] 185. Ramadan is the month in which the Quran 
[Page 21, Line 44] was revealed. Guidance for humanity, and 
[Page 21, Line 45] clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall fast it. But  whoever is sick, or on a journey, 
[Page 21, Line 46] then a number of other days. Allah desires 
[Page 21, Line 47] ease for you, and does not desire hardship for 
[Page 21, Line 48] you, that you may complete the number, and 
[Page 21, Line 49] celebrate Allah for having guided you, so that 
[Page 21, Line 50] you may be thankful.  
[Page 21, Line 51] 186. And when My ser vants ask you about Me, 
[Page 21, Line 52] I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when 
[Page 21, Line 53] he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and 
[Page 21, Line 54] have faith in Me, that they may be rightly 
[Page 21, Line 55] guided.  
[Page 21, Line 56] 187. Permitted for you is intercourse with your 
[Page 21, Line 57] wives on the night of the fast. They are a  gar-
[Page 21, Line 58] ment for you, and you are a garment for 
[Page 21, Line 59] them. Allah knows that you used to betray 
[Page 21, Line 60] yourselves, but He turned to you and par-
[Page 21, Line 61] doned you. So approach them now, and seek 
[Page 21, Line 62] what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and 
[Page 21, Line 63] drink until the white streak of dawn can be  
[Page 21, Line 64] distinguished from the black streak. Then 
[Page 21, Line 65] complete the fast until nightfall. But do not 
[Page 21, Line 66] approach them while you are in retreat at the 
[Page 21, Line 67] mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do not come near them. Allah thus clarifies His 
[Page 21, Line 68] revelations to the people, tha t they may attain 
[Page 21, Line 69] piety.  
[Page 21, Line 70] 188. And do not consume one another’s wealth 
[Page 21, Line 71] by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the officials in order to consume part of other 
[Page 21, Line 72] people’s wealth illicitly, while you know.  
[Page 21, Line 73] 189. They ask you about the crescents. Say, 
[Page 21, Line 74] “They ar e timetables for people, and for the 
[Page 21, Line 75] Hajj.” It is not virtuous that you approach 
[Page 21, Line 76] homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pi-
[Page 21, Line 77] ous. So approach homes from their doors, 
[Page 21, Line 78] and observe Allah, that you may succeed.  
[Page 21, Line 79] 190. And fight in the cause of Allah those who 
[Page 21, Line 80] fight you, but do not commit aggression; Al-
[Page 21, Line 81] lah does not love the aggressors.  
[Page 21, Line 82] 191. And kill them wherever you overtake 
[Page 21, Line 83] them, and expel them from where they had 
[Page 21, Line 84] expelled you. Oppression is more serious than murder. But do not fight them at the Sa-
[Page 21, Line 85] cred Mosque,  unless they fight you there. If 
[Page 21, Line 86] they fight you, then kill them. Such is the ret-
[Page 21, Line 87] ribution of the disbelievers.  
[Page 21, Line 88] 10 
[Page 22, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 22, Line 2] 192. But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving 
[Page 22, Line 3] and Merciful.  
[Page 22, Line 4] 193. And fight them until there is no oppres-
[Page 22, Line 5] sion, and worship becomes devoted to All ah 
[Page 22, Line 6] alone. But if they cease, then let there be no 
[Page 22, Line 7] hostility except against the oppressors.  
[Page 22, Line 8] 194. The sacred month for the sacred month; 
[Page 22, Line 9] and sacrilege calls for retaliation. Whoever 
[Page 22, Line 10] commits aggression against you, retaliate against him in the same measure as  he has 
[Page 22, Line 11] committed against you. And be conscious of Allah, and know that Allah is with the right-
[Page 22, Line 12] eous.  
[Page 22, Line 13] 195. And spend in the cause of Allah, and do 
[Page 22, Line 14] not throw yourselves with your own hands 
[Page 22, Line 15] into ruin, and be charitable. Allah loves the 
[Page 22, Line 16] charitable.  
[Page 22, Line 17] 196. And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for 
[Page 22, Line 18] Allah. But if you are prevented, then what-
[Page 22, Line 19] ever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave your heads until the offering has reached its 
[Page 22, Line 20] destination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an 
[Page 22, Line 21] injury of the head, then redemption of  fast-
[Page 22, Line 22] ing, or charity, or worship. When you are se-
[Page 22, Line 23] cure: whoever continues the Umrah until the 
[Page 22, Line 24] Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. But 
[Page 22, Line 25] if he lacks the means, then fasting for three 
[Page 22, Line 26] days during the Hajj and seven when you 
[Page 22, Line 27] have returned, making ten in  all. This is for 
[Page 22, Line 28] he whose household is not present at the Sa-
[Page 22, Line 29] cred Mosque. And remain conscious of Al-
[Page 22, Line 30] lah, and know that Allah is stern in retribu-
[Page 22, Line 31] tion.  
[Page 22, Line 32] 197. The Hajj is during specific months. Who-
[Page 22, Line 33] ever decides to perform the Hajj— there shall 
[Page 22, Line 34] be no sexual rela tions, nor misconduct, nor 
[Page 22, Line 35] quarrelling during the Hajj. And whatever 
[Page 22, Line 36] good you do, Allah knows it. And take provi-
[Page 22, Line 37] sions, but the best provision is righteousness. 
[Page 22, Line 38] And be mindful of Me, O people of under-
[Page 22, Line 39] standing.  
[Page 22, Line 40] 198. You commit no error by seeking bounty 
[Page 22, Line 41] from  your Lord. When you disperse from Ar-
[Page 22, Line 42] afat, remember Allah at the Sacred Land-
[Page 22, Line 43] mark. And remember Him as He has guided 
[Page 22, Line 44] you. Although, before that, you were of those 
[Page 22, Line 45] astray.  199. Then disperse from where the people dis-
[Page 22, Line 46] perse, and ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is 
[Page 22, Line 47] Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  
[Page 22, Line 48] 200. When you have completed your rites, re-
[Page 22, Line 49] member Allah as you remember your par-
[Page 22, Line 50] ents, or even more. Among the people is he 
[Page 22, Line 51] who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” 
[Page 22, Line 52] yet he has no share in the Hereafter.  
[Page 22, Line 53] 201. And among  them is he who says, “Our 
[Page 22, Line 54] Lord, give us goodness in this world, and 
[Page 22, Line 55] goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us 
[Page 22, Line 56] from the torment of the Fire.”  
[Page 22, Line 57] 202. These will have a share of what they have 
[Page 22, Line 58] earned. Allah is swift in reckoning.  
[Page 22, Line 59] 203. And remember Allah during  the desig-
[Page 22, Line 60] nated days. But whoever hurries on in two 
[Page 22, Line 61] days commits no wrong, and whoever stays on commits no wrong —provided he main-
[Page 22, Line 62] tains righteousness. And obey Allah, and 
[Page 22, Line 63] know that to Him you will be gathered.  
[Page 22, Line 64] 204. Among the people is he whose speech 
[Page 22, Line 65] about the worldly life impresses you, and he 
[Page 22, Line 66] calls Allah to witness what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.  
[Page 22, Line 67] 205. When he gains power, he strives to spread 
[Page 22, Line 68] corruption on earth, destroying properties 
[Page 22, Line 69] and lives. Allah does not like corrup tion.  
[Page 22, Line 70] 206. And when he is told, “Beware of Allah,” 
[Page 22, Line 71] his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is 
[Page 22, Line 72] enough for him —a dreadful abode.  
[Page 22, Line 73] 207. And among the people is he who sells 
[Page 22, Line 74] himself seeking Allah’s approval. Allah is kind towards the servants.  
[Page 22, Line 75] 208. O you who believe! Enter into submission, 
[Page 22, Line 76] wholeheartedly, and do not follow the foot-
[Page 22, Line 77] steps of Satan; he is to you an outright enemy.  
[Page 22, Line 78] 209. But if you slip after the proofs have come 
[Page 22, Line 79] to you, know that Allah is Powerful and Wise.  
[Page 22, Line 80] 210. Are they waiting for Allah Himself to 
[Page 22, Line 81] come to them in the shadows of the clouds, 
[Page 22, Line 82] together with the angels, and thus the matter 
[Page 22, Line 83] is settled? All things are returned to Allah.  
[Page 22, Line 84] 211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear 
[Page 22, Line 85] signs We have given them. Whoever alters 
[Page 22, Line 86] 11 
[Page 23, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 23, Line 2] the blessing of Allah after it  has come to 
[Page 23, Line 3] him—Allah is severe in retribution.  
[Page 23, Line 4] 212. Beautified is the life of this world for those 
[Page 23, Line 5] who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who 
[Page 23, Line 6] believe. But the righteous will be above them 
[Page 23, Line 7] on the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides to whomever He wills w ithout measure.  
[Page 23, Line 8] 213. Humanity used to be one community; 
[Page 23, Line 9] then Allah sent the prophets, bringing good 
[Page 23, Line 10] news and giving warnings. And He sent 
[Page 23, Line 11] down with them the Scripture, with the truth, 
[Page 23, Line 12] to judge between people regarding their dif-
[Page 23, Line 13] ferences. But none differed over it except 
[Page 23, Line 14] those w ho were given it —after the proofs had 
[Page 23, Line 15] come to them —out of mutual envy between 
[Page 23, Line 16] them. Then Allah guided those who believed 
[Page 23, Line 17] to the truth they had disputed, in accordance 
[Page 23, Line 18] with His will. Allah guides whom He wills to 
[Page 23, Line 19] a straight path.  
[Page 23, Line 20] 214. Or do you expect to e nter Paradise before 
[Page 23, Line 21] the example of those who came before you 
[Page 23, Line 22] had reached you? Adversity and hardship had afflicted them, and they were so shaken 
[Page 23, Line 23] up, that the Messenger and those who be-
[Page 23, Line 24] lieved with him said, “When is Allah’s vic-
[Page 23, Line 25] tory?” Indeed, Allah’s victor y is near.  
[Page 23, Line 26] 215. They ask you what they should give. Say, 
[Page 23, Line 27] “Whatever charity you give is for the parents, 
[Page 23, Line 28] and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it.  
[Page 23, Line 29] 216. Fighting is ordained for you, even though 
[Page 23, Line 30] you dislike it. But it may be that you dislike 
[Page 23, Line 31] something while it is good for you, and it may 
[Page 23, Line 32] be that you like something while it is bad for 
[Page 23, Line 33] you. Allah knows, and you do not know.  
[Page 23, Line 34] 217. They ask you about fighting during the 
[Page 23, Line 35] Holy Month. Say, “Fightin g during it is de-
[Page 23, Line 36] plorable; but to bar others from Allah’s path, 
[Page 23, Line 37] and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent ac-
[Page 23, Line 38] cess to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its peo-
[Page 23, Line 39] ple from it, are more deplorable with Allah. 
[Page 23, Line 40] And persecution is more serious than killing. 
[Page 23, Line 41] They will not  cease to fight you until they 
[Page 23, Line 42] turn you back from your religion, if they can. Whoever among you turns back from his re-ligion, and dies a disbeliever —those are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life, 
[Page 23, Line 43] and in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates 
[Page 23, Line 44] of the Fire, abiding in it forever.  
[Page 23, Line 45] 218. Those who believed, and those who mi-
[Page 23, Line 46] grated and fought for the sake of Allah—
[Page 23, Line 47] those look forward to Allah’s mercy. Allah is 
[Page 23, Line 48] Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 23, Line 49] 219. They ask you about intoxicants and gam-
[Page 23, Line 50] bling. Say, “There is gros s sin in them, and 
[Page 23, Line 51] some benefits for people, but their sinfulness 
[Page 23, Line 52] outweighs their benefit.” And they ask you 
[Page 23, Line 53] about what they should give: say, “The sur-
[Page 23, Line 54] plus.” Thus Allah explains the revelations to 
[Page 23, Line 55] you, so that you may think.  
[Page 23, Line 56] 220. About this world and the n ext. And they 
[Page 23, Line 57] ask you about orphans. Say, “Improvement 
[Page 23, Line 58] for them is best. And if you intermix with 
[Page 23, Line 59] them, then they are your brethren.” Allah 
[Page 23, Line 60] knows the dishonest from the honest. Had 
[Page 23, Line 61] Allah willed, He could have overburdened 
[Page 23, Line 62] you. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 23, Line 63] 221. Do not marry idolatresses, unless they 
[Page 23, Line 64] have believed. A believing maid is better than 
[Page 23, Line 65] an idolatress, even if you like her. And do not 
[Page 23, Line 66] marry idolaters, unless they have believed. A 
[Page 23, Line 67] believing servant is better than an idolater, 
[Page 23, Line 68] even if you like him. These call to the Fire, but 
[Page 23, Line 69] Allah calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, 
[Page 23, Line 70] by His leave. He makes clear His communi-cations to the people, that they may be mind-ful. 
[Page 23, Line 71] 222. And they ask you about menstruation: 
[Page 23, Line 72] say, “It is harmful, so keep away from women 
[Page 23, Line 73] during menst ruation. And do not approach 
[Page 23, Line 74] them until they have become pure. Once they have become pure, approach them in the way 
[Page 23, Line 75] Allah has directed you.” Allah loves the re-pentant, and He loves those who keep clean.”  
[Page 23, Line 76] 223. Your women are cultivation for you; so 
[Page 23, Line 77] approach  your cultivation whenever you like, 
[Page 23, Line 78] and send ahead for yourselves. And fear Al-
[Page 23, Line 79] lah, and know that you will meet Him. And 
[Page 23, Line 80] give good news to the believers.  
[Page 23, Line 81] 224. And do not allow your oaths in Allah's 
[Page 23, Line 82] name to hinder you from virtue, and right-
[Page 23, Line 83] eousness, and mak ing peace between people. 
[Page 23, Line 84] Allah is Listener and Knower.  
[Page 23, Line 85] 12 
[Page 24, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 24, Line 2] 225. Allah does not hold you responsible for 
[Page 24, Line 3] your unintentional oaths, but He holds you 
[Page 24, Line 4] responsible for your intentions. Allah is For-
[Page 24, Line 5] giving and Forbearing.  
[Page 24, Line 6] 226. Those who vow abstinence from their 
[Page 24, Line 7] wives must wait for four months. But if they 
[Page 24, Line 8] reconcile— Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 24, Line 9] 227. And if they resolve to divorce —Allah is 
[Page 24, Line 10] Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 24, Line 11] 228. Divorced women shall wait by themselves 
[Page 24, Line 12] for three periods. And it is not lawful for 
[Page 24, Line 13] them to conceal what Allah has created in 
[Page 24, Line 14] their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the 
[Page 24, Line 15] Last Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have 
[Page 24, Line 16] the better right to take them back, if they de-
[Page 24, Line 17] sire reconciliation. And women have rights 
[Page 24, Line 18] similar to their obligations, according to what 
[Page 24, Line 19] is fai r. But men have a degree over them. Al-
[Page 24, Line 20] lah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 24, Line 21] 229. Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either 
[Page 24, Line 22] honorable retention, or setting free kindly. It is not lawful for you to take back anything 
[Page 24, Line 23] you have given them, unless they fear that 
[Page 24, Line 24] they cannot mai ntain Allah's limits. If you 
[Page 24, Line 25] fear that they cannot maintain Allah’s limits, 
[Page 24, Line 26] then there is no blame on them if she sacri-
[Page 24, Line 27] fices something for her release. These are Al-
[Page 24, Line 28] lah’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those 
[Page 24, Line 29] who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.  
[Page 24, Line 30] 230. If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful 
[Page 24, Line 31] for him again until she has married another 
[Page 24, Line 32] husband. If the latter divorces her, then there 
[Page 24, Line 33] is no blame on them for reuniting, provided 
[Page 24, Line 34] they think they can maintain Allah's limits. 
[Page 24, Line 35] These are Allah’s limits;  He makes them clear 
[Page 24, Line 36] to people who know.  
[Page 24, Line 37] 231. When you divorce women, and they have 
[Page 24, Line 38] reached their term, either retain them amica-
[Page 24, Line 39] bly, or release them amicably. But do not re-
[Page 24, Line 40] tain them to hurt them and commit aggres-
[Page 24, Line 41] sion. Whoever does that has wronged him-
[Page 24, Line 42] self. And do not take Allah’s revelations for a 
[Page 24, Line 43] joke. And remember Allah's favor to you, and 
[Page 24, Line 44] that He revealed to you the Scripture and 
[Page 24, Line 45] Wisdom to teach you. And fear Allah, and 
[Page 24, Line 46] know that Allah is aware of everything.  232. When you divorce women, and they have 
[Page 24, Line 47] reached their term, do not prevent them from 
[Page 24, Line 48] marrying their husbands, provided they 
[Page 24, Line 49] agree on fair terms. Thereby is advised who-
[Page 24, Line 50] ever among you believes in Allah and the Last 
[Page 24, Line 51] Day. That is better and more decent for you. 
[Page 24, Line 52] Allah knows, and you do not know.  
[Page 24, Line 53] 233. Mothers may nurse their infants for two 
[Page 24, Line 54] whole years, for those who desire to complete 
[Page 24, Line 55] the nursing -period. It is the duty of the father 
[Page 24, Line 56] to provide for them and clothe them in a 
[Page 24, Line 57] proper manner. No soul shall be burdened 
[Page 24, Line 58] beyond its capacity. No mother shall be 
[Page 24, Line 59] harmed on account of her child, and no fa-
[Page 24, Line 60] ther shall be harmed on account of his child. 
[Page 24, Line 61] The same duty rests upon the heir. If the cou-
[Page 24, Line 62] ple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing 
[Page 24, Line 63] so. You commit no error by hiring nurs ing-
[Page 24, Line 64] mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And 
[Page 24, Line 65] be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is See-
[Page 24, Line 66] ing of what you do.  
[Page 24, Line 67] 234. As for those among you who die and leave 
[Page 24, Line 68] widows behind, their widows shall wait by 
[Page 24, Line 69] themselves for four months and ten days. 
[Page 24, Line 70] When they have  reached their term, there is 
[Page 24, Line 71] no blame on you regarding what they might 
[Page 24, Line 72] honorably do with themselves. Allah is fully 
[Page 24, Line 73] acquainted with what you do.  
[Page 24, Line 74] 235. You commit no error by announcing your 
[Page 24, Line 75] engagement to women, or by keeping it to 
[Page 24, Line 76] yourselves. Allah knows t hat you will be 
[Page 24, Line 77] thinking about them. But do not meet them secretly, unless you have something proper to 
[Page 24, Line 78] say. And do not confirm the marriage tie un-
[Page 24, Line 79] til the writing is fulfilled. And know that Al-
[Page 24, Line 80] lah knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him. And know tha t Allah is Forgiving and 
[Page 24, Line 81] Forbearing.  
[Page 24, Line 82] 236. You commit no error by divorcing women 
[Page 24, Line 83] before having touched them, or before hav-
[Page 24, Line 84] ing set the dowry for them. And compensate 
[Page 24, Line 85] them —the wealthy according to his means, 
[Page 24, Line 86] and the poor according to his means —with a 
[Page 24, Line 87] fair co mpensation, a duty upon the doers of 
[Page 24, Line 88] good.

[Page 25, Line 2] 237. If you divorce them before you have 
[Page 25, Line 3] touched them, but after you had set the 
[Page 25, Line 4] dowry for them, give them half of what you 
[Page 25, Line 5] specified —unless they forego the right, or the 
[Page 25, Line 6] one in whose hand is the marriage contract  
[Page 25, Line 7] foregoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety. 
[Page 25, Line 8] And do not forget generosity between one 
[Page 25, Line 9] another. Allah is seeing of everything you do.  
[Page 25, Line 10] 238. Guard your prayers, and the middle 
[Page 25, Line 11] prayer, and stand before Allah in devotion.  
[Page 25, Line 12] 239. But if you are in fear, then on  foot, or rid-
[Page 25, Line 13] ing. And when you are safe, remember Allah, as He taught you what you did not know.  
[Page 25, Line 14] 240. Those of you who die and leave wives be-
[Page 25, Line 15] hind —a will shall provide their wives with 
[Page 25, Line 16] support for a year, provided they do not 
[Page 25, Line 17] leave. If they leave, you are n ot to blame for 
[Page 25, Line 18] what they do with themselves, provided it is 
[Page 25, Line 19] reasonable. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 25, Line 20] 241. And divorced women shall be provided 
[Page 25, Line 21] for, equitably —a duty upon the righteous.  
[Page 25, Line 22] 242. Allah thus explains His revelations to you, 
[Page 25, Line 23] so that you may understand.  
[Page 25, Line 24] 243. Have you not considered those who fled 
[Page 25, Line 25] their homes, by the thousands, fearful of 
[Page 25, Line 26] death? Allah said to them, “Die.” Then He re-
[Page 25, Line 27] vived them. Allah is Gracious towards the 
[Page 25, Line 28] people, but most people are not appreciative.  
[Page 25, Line 29] 244. Fight in the cause of  Allah, and know that 
[Page 25, Line 30] Allah is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 25, Line 31] 245. Who is he who will offer Allah a generous 
[Page 25, Line 32] loan, so He will multiply it for him manifold? 
[Page 25, Line 33] Allah receives and amplifies, and to Him you 
[Page 25, Line 34] will be returned.  
[Page 25, Line 35] 246. Have you not considered the notables of 
[Page 25, Line 36] the Children of Israel after Moses? When 
[Page 25, Line 37] they said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint a king for us, and we will fight in the cause of 
[Page 25, Line 38] Allah.” He said, “Is it possible that, if fighting 
[Page 25, Line 39] was ordained for you, you would not fight?” 
[Page 25, Line 40] They said, “Why would we not f ight in the 
[Page 25, Line 41] cause of Allah, when we were driven out of our homes, along with our children?” But 
[Page 25, Line 42] when fighting was ordained for them, they 
[Page 25, Line 43] turned away, except for a few of them. But Al-
[Page 25, Line 44] lah is aware of the wrongdoers.  247. Their prophet said to them, “Allah has ap-
[Page 25, Line 45] pointed Saul to be your king.” They said, 
[Page 25, Line 46] “How can he have authority over us, when we 
[Page 25, Line 47] are more worthy of authority than he, and he 
[Page 25, Line 48] was not given plenty of wealth?” He said, “Al-
[Page 25, Line 49] lah has chosen him over you, and has in-
[Page 25, Line 50] creased him in knowledge and stature .” Allah 
[Page 25, Line 51] bestows His sovereignty upon whomever He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.  
[Page 25, Line 52] 248. And their prophet said to them, “The 
[Page 25, Line 53] proof of his kingship is that the Ark will be restored to you, bringing tranquility from 
[Page 25, Line 54] your Lord, and relics left by the fa mily of Mo-
[Page 25, Line 55] ses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried 
[Page 25, Line 56] by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you 
[Page 25, Line 57] are believers.”  
[Page 25, Line 58] 249. When Saul set out with the troops, he said, 
[Page 25, Line 59] “Allah will be testing you with a river. Who-
[Page 25, Line 60] ever drinks from it does not belong wit h me. 
[Page 25, Line 61] But whoever does not drink from it, does be-
[Page 25, Line 62] long with me, except for whoever scoops up 
[Page 25, Line 63] a little with his hand.” But they drank from it, 
[Page 25, Line 64] except for a few of them. Then, when he 
[Page 25, Line 65] crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, “We have no stre ngth to face 
[Page 25, Line 66] Goliath and his troops today.” But those who knew that they would meet Allah said, “How 
[Page 25, Line 67] many a small group has defeated a large 
[Page 25, Line 68] group by Allah’s will. Allah is with the stead-
[Page 25, Line 69] fast.”  
[Page 25, Line 70] 250. And when they confronted Goliath and 
[Page 25, Line 71] his troops, they sai d, “Our Lord, pour down 
[Page 25, Line 72] patience on us, and strengthen our foothold, and support us against the faithless people.”  
[Page 25, Line 73] 251. And they defeated them by Allah’s leave, 
[Page 25, Line 74] and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him 
[Page 25, Line 75] sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as 
[Page 25, Line 76] He willed. Were it not for Allah restraining 
[Page 25, Line 77] the people, some by means of others, the 
[Page 25, Line 78] earth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is 
[Page 25, Line 79] gracious towards mankind.  
[Page 25, Line 80] 252. These are Allah’s revelations, which We 
[Page 25, Line 81] recite to you in truth. You are one of the mes-
[Page 25, Line 82] sengers.  
[Page 25, Line 83] 253. These messengers: We gave some ad-
[Page 25, Line 84] vantage over others. To some of them Allah spoke directly, and some He raised in rank. 
[Page 25, Line 85] 14 
[Page 26, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 26, Line 2] We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles, 
[Page 26, Line 3] and We strengthened him with the Holy 
[Page 26, Line 4] Spirit. Had Allah willed, those who succeeded 
[Page 26, Line 5] them woul d not have fought one another, af-
[Page 26, Line 6] ter the clear signs had come to them; but they 
[Page 26, Line 7] disputed; some of them believed, and some of 
[Page 26, Line 8] them disbelieved. Had Allah willed, they 
[Page 26, Line 9] would not have fought one another; but Allah 
[Page 26, Line 10] does whatever He desires.  
[Page 26, Line 11] 254. O you who beli eve! Spend from what We 
[Page 26, Line 12] have given you, before a Day comes in which there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor 
[Page 26, Line 13] intercession. The disbelievers are the wrong-
[Page 26, Line 14] doers.  
[Page 26, Line 15] 255. Allah! There is no god except He, the Liv-
[Page 26, Line 16] ing, the Everlasting. Neither slumber over-
[Page 26, Line 17] takes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every-
[Page 26, Line 18] thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
[Page 26, Line 19] Who is he that can intercede with Him except 
[Page 26, Line 20] with His permission? He knows what is be-
[Page 26, Line 21] fore them, and what is behind them; and they 
[Page 26, Line 22] cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as 
[Page 26, Line 23] He wills. His Throne extends over the heav-
[Page 26, Line 24] ens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is the Most High, the 
[Page 26, Line 25] Great.  
[Page 26, Line 26] 256. There shall be no compu lsion in religion; 
[Page 26, Line 27] the right way has become distinct from the wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and be-
[Page 26, Line 28] lieves in Allah has grasped the most trustwor-
[Page 26, Line 29] thy handle; which does not break. Allah is 
[Page 26, Line 30] Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 26, Line 31] 257. Allah is the Lord of those who believe; He 
[Page 26, Line 32] brings them out of darkness and into light. As 
[Page 26, Line 33] for those who disbelieve, their lords are the evil ones; they bring them out of light and 
[Page 26, Line 34] into darkness —these are the inmates of the 
[Page 26, Line 35] Fire, in which they will abide forever.  
[Page 26, Line 36] 258. Have you not considered him who argued 
[Page 26, Line 37] with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him sovereignty? Abraham said, 
[Page 26, Line 38] “My Lord is He who gives life and causes 
[Page 26, Line 39] death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” 
[Page 26, Line 40] Abraham said, “Allah brings the sun from the East, so bring it from the West,” so the blas-
[Page 26, Line 41] phemer was confounded. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.  259. Or like him who passed by a town col-
[Page 26, Line 42] lapsed on its foundations. He said, “How can 
[Page 26, Line 43] Allah revive this after its demise?” Thereupon 
[Page 26, Line 44] Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, 
[Page 26, Line 45] and then resurrected him. He said, “For how 
[Page 26, Line 46] long have you tarried?” He said, “I have tar-
[Page 26, Line 47] ried for a day, or part of a day.” He said, “No. 
[Page 26, Line 48] You have tarried for a hundred years. Now 
[Page 26, Line 49] look at your food and your drink —it has not 
[Page 26, Line 50] spoiled —and look at your d onkey. We will 
[Page 26, Line 51] make you a wonder for mankind. And look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then 
[Page 26, Line 52] clothe them with flesh.” So when it became 
[Page 26, Line 53] clear to him, he said, “I know that Allah has 
[Page 26, Line 54] power over all things.”  
[Page 26, Line 55] 260. And when Abraham said, “My Lord, show 
[Page 26, Line 56] me how You give life to the dead.” He said, 
[Page 26, Line 57] “Have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but 
[Page 26, Line 58] to put my heart at ease.” He said, “Take four 
[Page 26, Line 59] birds, and incline them to yourself, then place 
[Page 26, Line 60] a part on each hill, then call to them; and they 
[Page 26, Line 61] will come rushing to you.  And know that Al-
[Page 26, Line 62] lah is Powerful and Wise.”  
[Page 26, Line 63] 261. The parable of those who spend their 
[Page 26, Line 64] wealth in Allah’s way is that of a grain that produces seven spikes; in each spike is a hun-
[Page 26, Line 65] dred grains. Allah multiplies for whom He 
[Page 26, Line 66] wills. Allah is Bounteous and Knowing .  
[Page 26, Line 67] 262. Those who spend their wealth in the way 
[Page 26, Line 68] of Allah, and then do not follow up what they 
[Page 26, Line 69] spent with reminders of their generosity or 
[Page 26, Line 70] with insults, will have their reward with their 
[Page 26, Line 71] Lord —they have nothing to fear, nor shall 
[Page 26, Line 72] they grieve.  
[Page 26, Line 73] 263. Kind words  and forgiveness are better 
[Page 26, Line 74] than charity followed by insults. Allah is Rich 
[Page 26, Line 75] and Clement.  
[Page 26, Line 76] 264. O you who believe! Do not nullify your 
[Page 26, Line 77] charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words, like him who spends his wealth to be 
[Page 26, Line 78] seen by the people, and does not be lieve in 
[Page 26, Line 79] Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of 
[Page 26, Line 80] a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour 
[Page 26, Line 81] strikes it, and leaves it bare —they gain noth-
[Page 26, Line 82] ing from their efforts. Allah does not guide 
[Page 26, Line 83] the disbelieving people.  
[Page 26, Line 84] 15 
[Page 27, Line 1] 2.  THE HEIFER   (al-Baqarah)  
[Page 27, Line 2] 265. And the parable of those who spend their 
[Page 27, Line 3] wealth seeking Allah’s approval, and to 
[Page 27, Line 4] strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on 
[Page 27, Line 5] a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce 
[Page 27, Line 6] is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then 
[Page 27, Line 7] dew is enough. Allah is seeing of everything 
[Page 27, Line 8] you do.  
[Page 27, Line 9] 266. Would any one of you like to have a garden 
[Page 27, Line 10] of palms and vines, under which rivers 
[Page 27, Line 11] flow —with all kinds of fruit in it for him, and 
[Page 27, Line 12] old age has stricken him, and he has weak 
[Page 27, Line 13] children —then a tornado with fire batters it, 
[Page 27, Line 14] and it burns down? Thus Allah makes clear 
[Page 27, Line 15] the si gns for you, so that you may reflect.  
[Page 27, Line 16] 267. O you who believe! Give of the good 
[Page 27, Line 17] things you have earned, and from what We 
[Page 27, Line 18] have produced for you from the earth. And 
[Page 27, Line 19] do not pick the inferior things to give away, 
[Page 27, Line 20] when you yourselves would not accept it ex-
[Page 27, Line 21] cept w ith eyes closed. And know that Allah is 
[Page 27, Line 22] Sufficient and Praiseworthy.  
[Page 27, Line 23] 268. Satan promises you poverty, and urges 
[Page 27, Line 24] you to immorality; but Allah promises you 
[Page 27, Line 25] forgiveness from Himself, and grace. Allah is 
[Page 27, Line 26] Embracing and Knowing.  
[Page 27, Line 27] 269. He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. 
[Page 27, Line 28] Whoever is given wisdom has been given 
[Page 27, Line 29] much good. But none pays heed except those 
[Page 27, Line 30] with insight.  
[Page 27, Line 31] 270. Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you 
[Page 27, Line 32] fulfill, Allah knows it. The wrongdoers have 
[Page 27, Line 33] no helpers.  
[Page 27, Line 34] 271. If you give charity openly, that is good . But 
[Page 27, Line 35] if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy in private, that is better for you. It will atone 
[Page 27, Line 36] for some of your misdeeds. Allah is cognizant 
[Page 27, Line 37] of what you do.  
[Page 27, Line 38] 272. Their guidance is not your responsibility, 
[Page 27, Line 39] but Allah guides whom He wills. Any charit y 
[Page 27, Line 40] you give is for your own good. Any charity 
[Page 27, Line 41] you give shall be for the sake of Allah. Any 
[Page 27, Line 42] charity you give will be repaid to you in full, 
[Page 27, Line 43] and you will not be wronged.  
[Page 27, Line 44] 273. It is for the poor; those who are restrained 
[Page 27, Line 45] in the way of Allah, and unable to trav el in 
[Page 27, Line 46] the land. The unaware would think them rich, due to their dignity. You will recognize 
[Page 27, Line 47] them by their features. They do not ask from 
[Page 27, Line 48] people insistently. Whatever charity you give, 
[Page 27, Line 49] Allah is aware of it.  
[Page 27, Line 50] 274. Those who spend their wealth by night 
[Page 27, Line 51] and day, privately and publicly, will receive 
[Page 27, Line 52] their reward from their Lord. They have 
[Page 27, Line 53] nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.  
[Page 27, Line 54] 275. Those who swallow usury will not rise, ex-
[Page 27, Line 55] cept as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. 
[Page 27, Line 56] That is because they say, “Commerce is like 
[Page 27, Line 57] usury.” But Allah has permitted commerce, 
[Page 27, Line 58] and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on re-
[Page 27, Line 59] ceiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may 
[Page 27, Line 60] keep his past earnings, and his case rests with 
[Page 27, Line 61] Allah. But whoever resumes —these are the 
[Page 27, Line 62] dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will ab ide 
[Page 27, Line 63] forever.  
[Page 27, Line 64] 276. Allah condemns usury, and He blesses 
[Page 27, Line 65] charities. Allah does not love any sinful in-
[Page 27, Line 66] grate.  
[Page 27, Line 67] 277. Those who believe, and do good deeds, 
[Page 27, Line 68] and pray regularly, and give charity —they 
[Page 27, Line 69] will have their reward with their Lord; they 
[Page 27, Line 70] will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.  
[Page 27, Line 71] 278. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and forgo 
[Page 27, Line 72] what remains of usury, if you are believers.  
[Page 27, Line 73] 279. If you do not, then take notice of a war by 
[Page 27, Line 74] Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, 
[Page 27, Line 75] you may keep your capital, neither wronging, 
[Page 27, Line 76] nor being wronged.  
[Page 27, Line 77] 280. But if he is in hardship, then deferment 
[Page 27, Line 78] until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity 
[Page 27, Line 79] is better for you, if you only knew.  
[Page 27, Line 80] 281. And guard yourselves against a Day when 
[Page 27, Line 81] you will be returned to Allah; then each soul will be rewarded  fully for what it has earned, 
[Page 27, Line 82] and they will not be wronged.  
[Page 27, Line 83] 282. O you who believe! When you incur debt 
[Page 27, Line 84] among yourselves for a certain period of time, write it down. And have a scribe write 
[Page 27, Line 85] in your presence, in all fairness. And let no 
[Page 27, Line 86] scribe refuse to wr ite, as Allah has taught 
[Page 27, Line 87] him. So let him write, and let the debtor dic-
[Page 27, Line 88] tate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and di-
[Page 27, Line 89] minish nothing from it. But if the debtor is 
[Page 27, Line 90] 16 
[Page 28, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 28, Line 2] mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dic-
[Page 28, Line 3] tate, then let his guardian dictate with hon-
[Page 28, Line 4] esty. And call to witness two men from 
[Page 28, Line 5] among you. If two men are not available, then 
[Page 28, Line 6] one man and two women whose testimony is 
[Page 28, Line 7] acceptable to all —if one of them fails to re-
[Page 28, Line 8] member, the other would remind her. Wit-
[Page 28, Line 9] nesses must not refuse when called upon. 
[Page 28, Line 10] And do not think it too trivial to write down, 
[Page 28, Line 11] whether small or large, including the time of repayment. That is more equitable with Al-
[Page 28, Line 12] lah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely 
[Page 28, Line 13] to prevent doubt— except in the case of a spot 
[Page 28, Line 14] transaction between you —then there is no 
[Page 28, Line 15] blame on you if you do not write it down. 
[Page 28, Line 16] And let there be witnesses whenever you con-
[Page 28, Line 17] clude a contract, and let no harm be done to 
[Page 28, Line 18] either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is 
[Page 28, Line 19] corruption on your part. And fear Allah. Al-
[Page 28, Line 20] lah teaches you. Allah is aware of everything.  
[Page 28, Line 21] 283. If you are on a journey, and cannot find a 
[Page 28, Line 22] scribe, then a security deposit should be 
[Page 28, Line 23] handed over. But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear Al-
[Page 28, Line 24] lah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 
[Page 28, Line 25] Whoever conc eals it is sinner at heart. Allah 
[Page 28, Line 26] is aware of what you do.  
[Page 28, Line 27] 284. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
[Page 28, Line 28] ens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is within your selves, or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom 
[Page 28, Line 29] He wills, and He  punishes whom He wills. 
[Page 28, Line 30] Allah is Able to do all things.  
[Page 28, Line 31] 285. The Messenger has believed in what was 
[Page 28, Line 32] revealed to him from his Lord, as did the be-lievers. They all have believed in Allah, and 
[Page 28, Line 33] His angels, and His scriptures, and His mes-
[Page 28, Line 34] sengers: “We make no d istinction between 
[Page 28, Line 35] any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our 
[Page 28, Line 36] Lord. To you is the destiny.”  
[Page 28, Line 37] 286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its 
[Page 28, Line 38] capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and 
[Page 28, Line 39] against it is what it commits. “ Our Lord, do 
[Page 28, Line 40] not condemn us if we forget or make a mis-
[Page 28, Line 41] take. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have 
[Page 28, Line 42] burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not 
[Page 28, Line 43] burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are ou r Lord and Mas-
[Page 28, Line 44] ter, so help us against the disbelieving peo-
[Page 28, Line 45] ple.”  

[Page 28, Line 47] 3. FAMILY OF IMRAN  
[Page 28, Line 48] (Ali ‘Imran ) 
[Page 28, Line 49] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 28, Line 50] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 28, Line 51] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 28, Line 52] 2. Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the 
[Page 28, Line 53] Eternal.  
[Page 28, Line 54] 3. He sent down to you the Book with the 
[Page 28, Line 55] Truth, confirming what came before it; and 
[Page 28, Line 56] He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.  
[Page 28, Line 57] 4. Aforetime, as guidance for mankind; and 
[Page 28, Line 58] He sent down the Criterion. Those who have rejected Allah’s signs will have a severe pun-
[Page 28, Line 59] ishment. Allah is Mighty, Abl e to take re-
[Page 28, Line 60] venge.  
[Page 28, Line 61] 5. Nothing is hidden from Allah, on earth or 
[Page 28, Line 62] in the heaven.  
[Page 28, Line 63] 6. It is He who forms you in the wombs as He 
[Page 28, Line 64] wills. There is no god except He, the Al-
[Page 28, Line 65] mighty, the Wise.  
[Page 28, Line 66] 7. It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some 
[Page 28, Line 67] of its verses are definitive; they are the foun-
[Page 28, Line 68] dation of the Book, and others are unspecific. 
[Page 28, Line 69] As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they 
[Page 28, Line 70] follow the unspecific part, seeking descent, 
[Page 28, Line 71] and seeking to derive an interpretation. But 
[Page 28, Line 72] none knows its interpretation except Allah  
[Page 28, Line 73] and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 
[Page 28, Line 74] “We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But 
[Page 28, Line 75] none recollects except those with under-
[Page 28, Line 76] standing.  
[Page 28, Line 77] 8. “Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to 
[Page 28, Line 78] swerve after You have guided us, and bestow 
[Page 28, Line 79] on us mercy from Your presence; Y ou are the 
[Page 28, Line 80] Giver.”  
[Page 28, Line 81] 9. “Our Lord, You will gather the people for a 
[Page 28, Line 82] Day in which there is no doubt.” Allah will 
[Page 28, Line 83] never break His promise.  
[Page 28, Line 84] 17 
[Page 29, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 29, Line 2] 10. As for those who disbelieve, neither their 
[Page 29, Line 3] wealth nor their children will avail them any-
[Page 29, Line 4] thing against Allah. These wi ll be fuel for the 
[Page 29, Line 5] Fire.  
[Page 29, Line 6] 11. Like the behavior of Pharaoh’s people and 
[Page 29, Line 7] those before them. They rejected Our signs, 
[Page 29, Line 8] so Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is 
[Page 29, Line 9] Strict in retribution.  
[Page 29, Line 10] 12. Say to those who disbelieve, “You will be 
[Page 29, Line 11] defeated, and rounded up i nto Hell —an aw-
[Page 29, Line 12] ful resting -place.”  
[Page 29, Line 13] 13. There was a sign for you in the two parties 
[Page 29, Line 14] that met. One party fighting in the way of Al-
[Page 29, Line 15] lah, and the other was disbelieving. They saw 
[Page 29, Line 16] them with their own eyes twice their number. 
[Page 29, Line 17] But Allah supports with His help whome ver 
[Page 29, Line 18] He wills. In that is a lesson for those with in-sight.  
[Page 29, Line 19] 14. Adorned for the people is the love of de-
[Page 29, Line 20] sires, such as women, and children, and piles 
[Page 29, Line 21] upon piles of gold and silver, and branded 
[Page 29, Line 22] horses, and livestock, and fields. These are 
[Page 29, Line 23] the conveniences of the worldly life, but with 
[Page 29, Line 24] Allah lies the finest resort.  
[Page 29, Line 25] 15. Say, “Shall I inform you of something bet-
[Page 29, Line 26] ter than that? For those who are righteous, 
[Page 29, Line 27] with their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will remain forever, 
[Page 29, Line 28] and purified spouses, and acceptance from 
[Page 29, Line 29] Allah.” Allah is Observant of the servants.  
[Page 29, Line 30] 16. Those who say, “Our Lord, we have be-
[Page 29, Line 31] lieved, so forgive us our sins, and save us 
[Page 29, Line 32] from the suffering of the Fire.”  
[Page 29, Line 33] 17. The patient, and the truthful, and the rev-
[Page 29, Line 34] erent, and the charitable, and  the seekers of 
[Page 29, Line 35] forgiveness at dawn.  
[Page 29, Line 36] 18. Allah bears witness that there is no god but 
[Page 29, Line 37] He, as do the angels, and those endowed with 
[Page 29, Line 38] knowledge —upholding justice. There is no 
[Page 29, Line 39] god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.  
[Page 29, Line 40] 19. Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to 
[Page 29, Line 41] whom the Scripture was given differed only after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs 
[Page 29, Line 42] of Allah— Allah is quick to take account.  20. If they argue with you, say, “I have surren-
[Page 29, Line 43] dered myself to Allah, and those who follow 
[Page 29, Line 44] me.” And say to those who were given the 
[Page 29, Line 45] Scripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you 
[Page 29, Line 46] surrendered?” If they have surrendered, then 
[Page 29, Line 47] they are guided; but if they turn away, then 
[Page 29, Line 48] your duty is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the 
[Page 29, Line 49] servants.  
[Page 29, Line 50] 21. As for those who defy Allah’s revelations, 
[Page 29, Line 51] and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those 
[Page 29, Line 52] who advocate justice among the people—
[Page 29, Line 53] promise them a painful retribution.  
[Page 29, Line 54] 22. They are those whose deeds will come to 
[Page 29, Line 55] nothing, in this world and in the Hereafter; and they will have no savi ors. 
[Page 29, Line 56] 23. Have you not considered those who were 
[Page 29, Line 57] given a share of the Scripture, as they were 
[Page 29, Line 58] called to the Scripture of Allah to arbitrate be-
[Page 29, Line 59] tween them; then some of them turned back, 
[Page 29, Line 60] and declined?  
[Page 29, Line 61] 24. That is because they said, “The Fire will not 
[Page 29, Line 62] touch us  except for a limited number of 
[Page 29, Line 63] days.” They have been misled in their religion 
[Page 29, Line 64] by the lies they fabricated.  
[Page 29, Line 65] 25. How about when We gather them for a 
[Page 29, Line 66] Day in which there is no doubt, and each soul 
[Page 29, Line 67] will be paid in full for what it has earned, and 
[Page 29, Line 68] they will not be wronged?  
[Page 29, Line 69] 26. Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty. You 
[Page 29, Line 70] grant sovereignty to whom You will, and You 
[Page 29, Line 71] strip sovereignty from whom you will. You honor whom you will, and You humiliate 
[Page 29, Line 72] whom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. 
[Page 29, Line 73] You are Capable of all thing s.” 
[Page 29, Line 74] 27. “You merge the night into the day, and 
[Page 29, Line 75] You merge the day into the night; and you 
[Page 29, Line 76] bring the living out of the dead, and You 
[Page 29, Line 77] bring the dead out of the living; and You pro-
[Page 29, Line 78] vide for whom you will without measure.”  
[Page 29, Line 79] 28. Believers are not to take disbeliev ers for 
[Page 29, Line 80] friends instead of believers. Whoever does 
[Page 29, Line 81] that has nothing to do with Allah, unless it is to protect your own selves against them. Al-
[Page 29, Line 82] lah warns you to beware of Him. To Allah is 
[Page 29, Line 83] the destiny.  
[Page 29, Line 84] 18 
[Page 30, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 30, Line 2] 29. Say, “Whether you conceal what is in your 
[Page 30, Line 3] hearts, or disclose it, Allah knows it.” He 
[Page 30, Line 4] knows everything in the heavens and the 
[Page 30, Line 5] earth. Allah is Powerful over everything.  
[Page 30, Line 6] 30. On the Day when every soul finds all the 
[Page 30, Line 7] good it has done presented. And as for the 
[Page 30, Line 8] evil it has done, it will wish there were a great 
[Page 30, Line 9] distance between them. Allah cautions you of 
[Page 30, Line 10] Himself. Allah is Kind towards the servants.  
[Page 30, Line 11] 31. Say, “If you love Allah, then follow me, and 
[Page 30, Line 12] Allah will love you, and will forgive you your 
[Page 30, Line 13] sins.” Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 30, Line 14] 32. Say, “Obey Allah and the Mess enger.” But 
[Page 30, Line 15] if they turn away —Allah does not love the 
[Page 30, Line 16] faithless.  
[Page 30, Line 17] 33. Allah chose Adam, and Noah, and the fam-
[Page 30, Line 18] ily of Abraham, and the family of Imran, over all mankind.  
[Page 30, Line 19] 34. Offspring one of the other. Allah is Hearer 
[Page 30, Line 20] and Knower.  
[Page 30, Line 21] 35. The wife of Imran said, “My Lord, I have 
[Page 30, Line 22] vowed to You what is in my womb, dedi-
[Page 30, Line 23] cated, so accept from me; You are the Hearer 
[Page 30, Line 24] and Knower.”  
[Page 30, Line 25] 36. And when she delivered her, she said, “My 
[Page 30, Line 26] Lord, I have delivered a female,” and Allah 
[Page 30, Line 27] was well aware of what she has  delivered, 
[Page 30, Line 28] “and the male is not like the female, and I 
[Page 30, Line 29] have named her Mary, and have commended 
[Page 30, Line 30] her and her descendants to Your protection, 
[Page 30, Line 31] from Satan the outcast.”  
[Page 30, Line 32] 37. Her Lord accepted her with a gracious re-
[Page 30, Line 33] ception, and brought her a beautiful upbring-
[Page 30, Line 34] ing, and entrusted her to the care of Zecha-
[Page 30, Line 35] riah. Whenever Zechariah entered upon her in the sanctuary, he found her with provision. 
[Page 30, Line 36] He said, “O Mary, where did you get this 
[Page 30, Line 37] from?” She said, “It is from Allah; Allah pro-
[Page 30, Line 38] vides to whom He wills without reckoning. ” 
[Page 30, Line 39] 38. Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord; 
[Page 30, Line 40] he said, “My Lord, bestow on me good off-
[Page 30, Line 41] spring from Your presence; You are the 
[Page 30, Line 42] Hearer of Prayers.”  
[Page 30, Line 43] 39. Then the angels called out to him, as he 
[Page 30, Line 44] stood praying in the sanctuary: “Allah gives you good news of Joh n; confirming a Word 
[Page 30, Line 45] from Allah, and honorable, and moral, and a 
[Page 30, Line 46] prophet; one of the upright.”  
[Page 30, Line 47] 40. He said, “My Lord, how will I have a son, 
[Page 30, Line 48] when old age has overtaken me, and my wife 
[Page 30, Line 49] is barren?” He said, “Even so, Allah does 
[Page 30, Line 50] whatever He wills.”  
[Page 30, Line 51] 41. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, 
[Page 30, Line 52] “Your sign is that you shall not speak to the 
[Page 30, Line 53] people for three days, except by gestures. And 
[Page 30, Line 54] remember your Lord much, and praise in the 
[Page 30, Line 55] evening and the morning.”  
[Page 30, Line 56] 42. The angels said, “O Mary, Allah has chosen 
[Page 30, Line 57] you, an d has purified you. He has chosen you 
[Page 30, Line 58] over all the women of the world.  
[Page 30, Line 59] 43. “O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, and 
[Page 30, Line 60] bow down, and kneel with those who kneel.”  
[Page 30, Line 61] 44. These are accounts from the Unseen, 
[Page 30, Line 62] which We reveal to you. You were not with 
[Page 30, Line 63] them when they ca st their lots as to which of 
[Page 30, Line 64] them would take charge of Mary; nor were 
[Page 30, Line 65] you with them as they quarreled.  
[Page 30, Line 66] 45. The Angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you 
[Page 30, Line 67] good news of a Word from Him. His name is 
[Page 30, Line 68] the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, well -es-
[Page 30, Line 69] teemed in this world and the next, and one of 
[Page 30, Line 70] the nearest.  
[Page 30, Line 71] 46. He will speak to the people from the crib, 
[Page 30, Line 72] and in adulthood, and will be one of the 
[Page 30, Line 73] righteous.”  
[Page 30, Line 74] 47. She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child, 
[Page 30, Line 75] when no man has touched me?” He said, “It 
[Page 30, Line 76] will be so. Allah creates whatev er He wills. To 
[Page 30, Line 77] have anything done, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ 
[Page 30, Line 78] and it is.”  
[Page 30, Line 79] 48. And He will teach him the Scripture and 
[Page 30, Line 80] wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.  
[Page 30, Line 81] 49. A messenger to the Children of Israel: “I 
[Page 30, Line 82] have come to you with a sign from your Lord. 
[Page 30, Line 83] I make for you out of clay the figure of a bird; 
[Page 30, Line 84] then I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird 
[Page 30, Line 85] by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the 
[Page 30, Line 86] leprous, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s 
[Page 30, Line 87] leave. And I inform you concerning what you 
[Page 30, Line 88] 19 
[Page 31, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 31, Line 2] eat, and what you store in your home s. In that 
[Page 31, Line 3] is a sign for you, if you are believers.”  
[Page 31, Line 4] 50. “And verifying what lies before me of the 
[Page 31, Line 5] Torah, and to make lawful for you some of 
[Page 31, Line 6] what was forbidden to you. I have come to 
[Page 31, Line 7] you with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah, and obey me.”  
[Page 31, Line 8] 51. “Allah i s my Lord and your Lord, so wor-
[Page 31, Line 9] ship Him. That is a straight path.”  
[Page 31, Line 10] 52. When Jesus sensed disbelief on their part, 
[Page 31, Line 11] he said, “Who are my allies towards Allah?” 
[Page 31, Line 12] The disciples said, “We are Allah’s allies; we 
[Page 31, Line 13] have believed in Allah, and bear witness that 
[Page 31, Line 14] we su bmit.”  
[Page 31, Line 15] 53. “Our Lord, we have believed in what You 
[Page 31, Line 16] have revealed, and we have followed the Mes-
[Page 31, Line 17] senger, so count us among the witnesses.”  
[Page 31, Line 18] 54. They planned, and Allah planned; but Al-
[Page 31, Line 19] lah is the Best of planners.  
[Page 31, Line 20] 55. Allah said, “O Jesus, I am terminating your  
[Page 31, Line 21] life, and raising you to Me, and clearing you 
[Page 31, Line 22] of those who disbelieve. And I will make those who follow you superior to those who 
[Page 31, Line 23] disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection. 
[Page 31, Line 24] Then to Me is your return; then I will judge 
[Page 31, Line 25] between you regarding what you were d is-
[Page 31, Line 26] puting.  
[Page 31, Line 27] 56. As for those who disbelieve, I will punish 
[Page 31, Line 28] them with a severe punishment, in this world 
[Page 31, Line 29] and the next, and they will have no helpers.  
[Page 31, Line 30] 57. And as for those who believe and do good 
[Page 31, Line 31] works, He will give them their rewards in full. 
[Page 31, Line 32] Allah does not l ove the unjust.”  
[Page 31, Line 33] 58. This is what We recite to you of the Verses 
[Page 31, Line 34] and the Wise Reminder.  
[Page 31, Line 35] 59. The likeness of Jesus in Allah’s sight is that 
[Page 31, Line 36] of Adam: He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be,” and he was.  
[Page 31, Line 37] 60. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be 
[Page 31, Line 38] of those who doubt.  
[Page 31, Line 39] 61. And if anyone disputes with you about 
[Page 31, Line 40] him, after the knowledge that has come to 
[Page 31, Line 41] you, say, “Come, let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let 
[Page 31, Line 42] us invoke Allah’s curse  on the liars.”  
[Page 31, Line 43] 62. This is the narrative of truth: there is no 
[Page 31, Line 44] god but Allah. Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.  
[Page 31, Line 45] 63. But if they turn away —Allah knows the 
[Page 31, Line 46] corrupt.  
[Page 31, Line 47] 64. Say, “O People of the Book, come to terms 
[Page 31, Line 48] common between us and you: that we wor-
[Page 31, Line 49] ship none b ut Allah, and that we associate 
[Page 31, Line 50] nothing with Him, and that none of us takes 
[Page 31, Line 51] others as lords besides Allah.” And if they 
[Page 31, Line 52] turn away, say, “Bear witness that we have 
[Page 31, Line 53] submitted.”  
[Page 31, Line 54] 65. O People of the Book! Why do you argue 
[Page 31, Line 55] about Abraham, when the Torah and the  
[Page 31, Line 56] Gospel were not revealed until after him? 
[Page 31, Line 57] Will you not reason?  
[Page 31, Line 58] 66. Here you are— you argue about things you 
[Page 31, Line 59] know, but why do you argue about things you 
[Page 31, Line 60] do not know? Allah knows, and you do not 
[Page 31, Line 61] know.  
[Page 31, Line 62] 67. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Chris-
[Page 31, Line 63] tian, but he wa s a Monotheist, a Muslim. And 
[Page 31, Line 64] he was not of the Polytheists.  
[Page 31, Line 65] 68. The people most deserving of Abraham are 
[Page 31, Line 66] those who followed him, and this prophet, 
[Page 31, Line 67] and those who believe. Allah is the Guardian 
[Page 31, Line 68] of the believers.  
[Page 31, Line 69] 69. A party of the People of the Book would 
[Page 31, Line 70] love to lead you astray, but they only lead 
[Page 31, Line 71] themselves astray, and they do not realize it.  
[Page 31, Line 72] 70. O People of the Book! Why do you reject 
[Page 31, Line 73] the revelations of Allah, even as you witness?  
[Page 31, Line 74] 71. O People of the Book! Why do you con-
[Page 31, Line 75] found the truth with falsehood, and  know-
[Page 31, Line 76] ingly conceal the truth?  
[Page 31, Line 77] 72. Some of the People of the Book say, “Be-
[Page 31, Line 78] lieve in what was revealed to the believers at 
[Page 31, Line 79] the beginning of the day, and reject it at its 
[Page 31, Line 80] end, so that they may return.”  
[Page 31, Line 81] 73. And trust none except those who follow 
[Page 31, Line 82] your religion.” Say, “Guidance is Allah’s 
[Page 31, Line 83] guidance. If someone is given the like of what 
[Page 31, Line 84] you were given, or they argue with you before 
[Page 31, Line 85] your Lord, say, “All grace is in Allah’s hand; 
[Page 31, Line 86] 20 
[Page 32, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 32, Line 2] He gives it to whomever He wills.” Allah is 
[Page 32, Line 3] Bounteous and Knowing.  
[Page 32, Line 4] 74. He specifies His m ercy for whomever He 
[Page 32, Line 5] wills. Allah is Possessor of Sublime Grace.  
[Page 32, Line 6] 75. Among the People of the Book is he, who, 
[Page 32, Line 7] if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will 
[Page 32, Line 8] give it back to you. And among them is he, 
[Page 32, Line 9] who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he 
[Page 32, Line 10] will not  give it back to you, unless you keep 
[Page 32, Line 11] after him. That is because they say, “We are 
[Page 32, Line 12] under no obligation towards the gentiles.” 
[Page 32, Line 13] They tell lies about Allah, and they know it.  
[Page 32, Line 14] 76. Indeed, whoever fulfills his commitments 
[Page 32, Line 15] and maintains piety —Allah loves the pio us. 
[Page 32, Line 16] 77. Those who exchange the covenant of Allah, 
[Page 32, Line 17] and their vows, for a small price, will have no 
[Page 32, Line 18] share in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on 
[Page 32, Line 19] the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify 
[Page 32, Line 20] them. They will have a painf ul punishment.  
[Page 32, Line 21] 78. And among them are those who twist the 
[Page 32, Line 22] Scripture with their tongues, that you may 
[Page 32, Line 23] think it from the Scripture, when it is not 
[Page 32, Line 24] from the Scripture. And they say, “It is from 
[Page 32, Line 25] Allah,” when it is not from Allah. They tell 
[Page 32, Line 26] lies and attribute t hem to Allah, knowingly.  
[Page 32, Line 27] 79. No person to whom Allah has given the 
[Page 32, Line 28] Scripture, and wisdom, and prophethood would ever say to the people, “Be my wor-
[Page 32, Line 29] shipers rather than Allah’s.” Rather, “Be peo-
[Page 32, Line 30] ple of the Lord, according to the Scripture 
[Page 32, Line 31] you teach, and the te achings you learn.”  
[Page 32, Line 32] 80. Nor would he command you to take the 
[Page 32, Line 33] angels and the prophets as lords. Would he 
[Page 32, Line 34] command you to infidelity after you have 
[Page 32, Line 35] submitted?  
[Page 32, Line 36] 81. Allah received the covenant of the proph-
[Page 32, Line 37] ets, “Inasmuch as I have given you of scrip-
[Page 32, Line 38] ture and wisd om; should a messenger come 
[Page 32, Line 39] to you verifying what you have, you shall be-
[Page 32, Line 40] lieve in him, and support him.” He said, “Do 
[Page 32, Line 41] you affirm My covenant and take it upon 
[Page 32, Line 42] yourselves?” They said, “We affirm it.” He 
[Page 32, Line 43] said, “Then bear witness, and I am with you 
[Page 32, Line 44] among the wi tnesses.”  82. Whoever turns away after that —these are 
[Page 32, Line 45] the deceitful.  
[Page 32, Line 46] 83. Do they desire other than the religion of 
[Page 32, Line 47] Allah, when to Him has submitted everything 
[Page 32, Line 48] in the heavens and the earth, willingly or un-
[Page 32, Line 49] willingly, and to Him they will be returned?  
[Page 32, Line 50] 84. Say, “We believe in Allah, and in what was 
[Page 32, Line 51] revealed to us; and in what was revealed to 
[Page 32, Line 52] Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to 
[Page 32, Line 53] Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from 
[Page 32, Line 54] their Lord. We make no distinction between 
[Page 32, Line 55] any of them, and to Him we submit.”  
[Page 32, Line 56] 85. Whoever seeks other than Islam as a reli-
[Page 32, Line 57] gion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.  
[Page 32, Line 58] 86. How will Allah guide a people who disbe-
[Page 32, Line 59] lieved after having believed, and had wit-
[Page 32, Line 60] nessed that the Messenger is true, and the 
[Page 32, Line 61] clear proofs had come to them? Allah does 
[Page 32, Line 62] not guide the unjust people.  
[Page 32, Line 63] 87. Those —their penalty is that upon them 
[Page 32, Line 64] falls the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and 
[Page 32, Line 65] of all mankind.  
[Page 32, Line 66] 88. Remaining in it eternally, withou t their 
[Page 32, Line 67] punishment being eased from them, and 
[Page 32, Line 68] without being reprieved.  
[Page 32, Line 69] 89. Except those who repent afterwards, and 
[Page 32, Line 70] reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 32, Line 71] 90. As for those who disbelieve after having 
[Page 32, Line 72] believed, then plunge deeper into disbelief, 
[Page 32, Line 73] their repentance will not be accepted; these 
[Page 32, Line 74] are the lost.  
[Page 32, Line 75] 91. As for those who disbelieve and die disbe-
[Page 32, Line 76] lievers, even the earth full of gold would not be accepted from any of them, were he to of-
[Page 32, Line 77] fer it for ransom. These will have a painful 
[Page 32, Line 78] torment, and will have no saviors.  
[Page 32, Line 79] 92. You will not attain virtuous conduct until 
[Page 32, Line 80] you give of what you cherish. Whatever you 
[Page 32, Line 81] give away, Allah is aware of it.  
[Page 32, Line 82] 93. All food was permissible to the Children of 
[Page 32, Line 83] Israel, except what Israel forbade for itself be-
[Page 32, Line 84] fore the Torah was revealed. Say, “Bring the 
[Page 32, Line 85] Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 32, Line 86] 21 
[Page 33, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 33, Line 2] 94. Whoever forges lies about Allah after 
[Page 33, Line 3] that—these are the unjust.  
[Page 33, Line 4] 95. Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow 
[Page 33, Line 5] the religion of Abraham the Monotheist; he 
[Page 33, Line 6] was not a Pagan.”  
[Page 33, Line 7] 96. The f irst house established for mankind is 
[Page 33, Line 8] the one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all 
[Page 33, Line 9] people.  
[Page 33, Line 10] 97. In it are evident signs; the Station of Abra-
[Page 33, Line 11] ham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pil-
[Page 33, Line 12] grimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all 
[Page 33, Line 13] who can make the journ ey. But as for those 
[Page 33, Line 14] who refuse —Allah is Independent of the 
[Page 33, Line 15] worlds.  
[Page 33, Line 16] 98. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you 
[Page 33, Line 17] reject the Revelations of Allah, when Allah 
[Page 33, Line 18] witnesses what you do?”  
[Page 33, Line 19] 99. Say, “O People of the Scripture, why do you 
[Page 33, Line 20] hinder from Allah’s path those who believe, 
[Page 33, Line 21] seeking to distort it, even though you are wit-nesses? Allah is not unaware of what you do.”  
[Page 33, Line 22] 100. O you who believe! If you obey a party of 
[Page 33, Line 23] those who were given the Scripture, they will 
[Page 33, Line 24] turn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.  
[Page 33, Line 25] 101. And how could you disbelieve, when Al-
[Page 33, Line 26] lah’s revelations are being recited to you, and among you is His Messenger? Whoever 
[Page 33, Line 27] cleaves to Allah has been guided to a straight 
[Page 33, Line 28] path.  
[Page 33, Line 29] 102. O you who believe! Revere Allah with due 
[Page 33, Line 30] reverence, and do not die except a s Muslims.  
[Page 33, Line 31] 103. And hold fast to the rope of Allah, alto-
[Page 33, Line 32] gether, and do not become divided. And re-
[Page 33, Line 33] member Allah’s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, 
[Page 33, Line 34] and by His grace you became brethren. And 
[Page 33, Line 35] you were on the brink of a pi t of fire, and He 
[Page 33, Line 36] saved you from it. Allah thus clarifies His rev-elations for you, so that you may be guided.  
[Page 33, Line 37] 104. And let there be among you a community 
[Page 33, Line 38] calling to virtue, and advocating righteous-
[Page 33, Line 39] ness, and deterring from evil. These are the 
[Page 33, Line 40] successful.  105. And do not be like those who separated 
[Page 33, Line 41] and disputed after the clear proofs came to them; for them is a great punishment.  
[Page 33, Line 42] 106. On the Day when some faces will be whit-
[Page 33, Line 43] ened, and some faces will be blackened. As 
[Page 33, Line 44] for those whose faces are blackened: “Did you  
[Page 33, Line 45] disbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the 
[Page 33, Line 46] punishment for having disbelieved.  
[Page 33, Line 47] 107. But as for those whose faces are whitened: 
[Page 33, Line 48] they are in Allah’s mercy, remaining in it for-
[Page 33, Line 49] ever.  
[Page 33, Line 50] 108. These are the revelations of Allah. We re-
[Page 33, Line 51] cite them to you in truth. Allah desires no in-
[Page 33, Line 52] justice for mankind.  
[Page 33, Line 53] 109. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
[Page 33, Line 54] ens and everything on earth, and to Allah all events are referred.  
[Page 33, Line 55] 110. You are the best community that ever 
[Page 33, Line 56] emerged for humanity: you advocate what is 
[Page 33, Line 57] moral, and forbid what is immoral, and be-
[Page 33, Line 58] lieve in Allah. Had the People of the Scripture 
[Page 33, Line 59] believed, it would have been better for them. 
[Page 33, Line 60] Among them are the believers, but most of 
[Page 33, Line 61] them are sinners.  
[Page 33, Line 62] 111. They will do you no harm, beyond insult-
[Page 33, Line 63] ing you. And if they fight you, they w ill turn 
[Page 33, Line 64] around and flee, then they will not be helped.  
[Page 33, Line 65] 112. They shall be humiliated wherever they 
[Page 33, Line 66] are encountered, except through a rope from 
[Page 33, Line 67] Allah, and a rope from the people; and they 
[Page 33, Line 68] incurred wrath from Allah, and were stricken with misery. That is be cause they rejected Al-
[Page 33, Line 69] lah’s revelations, and killed the prophets un-
[Page 33, Line 70] justly. That is because they rebelled and com-
[Page 33, Line 71] mitted aggression.  
[Page 33, Line 72] 113. They are not alike. Among the People of 
[Page 33, Line 73] the Scripture is a community that is upright; 
[Page 33, Line 74] they recite Allah’s revelations th roughout the 
[Page 33, Line 75] night, and they prostrate themselves.  
[Page 33, Line 76] 114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, 
[Page 33, Line 77] and advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and are quick to do good deeds. These are 
[Page 33, Line 78] among the righteous.  
[Page 33, Line 79] 115. Whatever good they do, they will not be 
[Page 33, Line 80] denied it. Allah knows the righteous.  
[Page 33, Line 81] 22 
[Page 34, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 34, Line 2] 116. As for those who disbelieve, neither their 
[Page 34, Line 3] possessions nor their children will avail them 
[Page 34, Line 4] anything against Allah. These are the inhab-
[Page 34, Line 5] itants of the Fire, abiding therein forever.  
[Page 34, Line 6] 117. The parable of what they spend in this  
[Page 34, Line 7] worldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes 
[Page 34, Line 8] the harvest of a people who have wronged 
[Page 34, Line 9] their souls, and destroys it. Allah did not 
[Page 34, Line 10] wrong them, but they wronged their own 
[Page 34, Line 11] selves.  
[Page 34, Line 12] 118. O you who believe! Do not befriend out-
[Page 34, Line 13] siders who never cease to wis h you harm. 
[Page 34, Line 14] They love to see you suffer. Hatred has al-
[Page 34, Line 15] ready appeared from their mouths, but what 
[Page 34, Line 16] their hearts conceal is worse. We have made 
[Page 34, Line 17] the messages clear for you, if you understand.  
[Page 34, Line 18] 119. There you are, you love them, but they do 
[Page 34, Line 19] not love you, and you  believe in the entire 
[Page 34, Line 20] scripture. And when they meet you, they say, 
[Page 34, Line 21] “We believe;” but when they are alone, they 
[Page 34, Line 22] bite their fingers in rage at you. Say, “Die in 
[Page 34, Line 23] your rage; Allah knows what is within the 
[Page 34, Line 24] hearts.”  
[Page 34, Line 25] 120. If something good happens to you, it up-
[Page 34, Line 26] sets them; but if something bad befalls you, 
[Page 34, Line 27] they rejoice at it. But if you persevere and 
[Page 34, Line 28] maintain righteousness, their schemes will 
[Page 34, Line 29] not harm you at all. Allah comprehends what 
[Page 34, Line 30] they do.  
[Page 34, Line 31] 121. Remember when you left your home in the 
[Page 34, Line 32] morning, to assign battle -positions for the 
[Page 34, Line 33] believers. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 34, Line 34] 122. When two groups among you almost fal-
[Page 34, Line 35] tered, but Allah was their Protector. So in Al-
[Page 34, Line 36] lah let the believers put their trust.  
[Page 34, Line 37] 123. Allah had given you victory at Badr, when 
[Page 34, Line 38] you were weak. So fear A llah, that you may be 
[Page 34, Line 39] thankful.  
[Page 34, Line 40] 124. When you said to the believers, “Is it not 
[Page 34, Line 41] enough for you that your Lord has reinforced 
[Page 34, Line 42] you with three thousand angels, sent down?”  
[Page 34, Line 43] 125. It is; but if you persevere and remain cau-
[Page 34, Line 44] tious, and they attack you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand 
[Page 34, Line 45] angels, well trained.  126. Allah made it but a message of hope for 
[Page 34, Line 46] you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Vic-
[Page 34, Line 47] tory comes only from Allah the Almighty, the 
[Page 34, Line 48] Wise.  
[Page 34, Line 49] 127. He thus cuts off a section of those who dis-
[Page 34, Line 50] believed, or subdues them, so they retreat dis-
[Page 34, Line 51] appointed.  
[Page 34, Line 52] 128. It is no concern of yours whether He re-
[Page 34, Line 53] deems them or punishes them. They are 
[Page 34, Line 54] wrongdoers.  
[Page 34, Line 55] 129. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
[Page 34, Line 56] ens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, 
[Page 34, Line 57] and He punishe s whom He wills. Allah is 
[Page 34, Line 58] Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  
[Page 34, Line 59] 130. O you who believe! Do not feed on usury, 
[Page 34, Line 60] compounded over and over, and fear Allah, 
[Page 34, Line 61] so that you may prosper.  
[Page 34, Line 62] 131. And guard yourselves against the Fire that 
[Page 34, Line 63] is prepared for the disbelievers.  
[Page 34, Line 64] 132. And obey Allah and the Messenger, that 
[Page 34, Line 65] you may obtain mercy.  
[Page 34, Line 66] 133. And race towards forgiveness from your 
[Page 34, Line 67] Lord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous.  
[Page 34, Line 68] 134. Those who give in prosperity and adver-
[Page 34, Line 69] sity, and those who r estrain anger, and those 
[Page 34, Line 70] who forgive people. Allah loves the doers of good.  
[Page 34, Line 71] 135. And those who, when they commit an in-
[Page 34, Line 72] decency or wrong themselves, remember Al-
[Page 34, Line 73] lah and ask forgiveness for their sins —and 
[Page 34, Line 74] who forgives sins except Allah? And they do 
[Page 34, Line 75] not persist  in their wrongdoing while they 
[Page 34, Line 76] know.  
[Page 34, Line 77] 136. Those —their reward is forgiveness from 
[Page 34, Line 78] their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent 
[Page 34, Line 79] is the reward of the workers.  
[Page 34, Line 80] 137. Many societies have passed away before 
[Page 34, Line 81] you. So travel the earth and note the fate of 
[Page 34, Line 82] the deniers.  
[Page 34, Line 83] 138. This is a proclamation to humanity, and 
[Page 34, Line 84] guidance, and advice for the righteous.  
[Page 34, Line 85] 23 
[Page 35, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Im ran) 
[Page 35, Line 2] 139. And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You 
[Page 35, Line 3] are the superior ones, if you are believers.  
[Page 35, Line 4] 140. If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound 
[Page 35, Line 5] has afflicted the others. Such days We alter-
[Page 35, Line 6] nate between the people, that Allah may 
[Page 35, Line 7] know those who believe, and take martyrs 
[Page 35, Line 8] from among you. Allah does not love the evil-
[Page 35, Line 9] doers.  
[Page 35, Line 10] 141. So that Allah may prove those who believe, 
[Page 35, Line 11] and eliminate th e disbelievers.  
[Page 35, Line 12] 142. Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before 
[Page 35, Line 13] Allah has distinguished those among you 
[Page 35, Line 14] who strive, and before He has distinguished 
[Page 35, Line 15] the steadfast?  
[Page 35, Line 16] 143. You used to wish for death before you 
[Page 35, Line 17] have faced it. Now you have seen it before your own eyes.  
[Page 35, Line 18] 144. Muhammad is no more than a messenger. 
[Page 35, Line 19] Messengers have passed on before him. If he 
[Page 35, Line 20] dies or gets killed, will you turn on your 
[Page 35, Line 21] heels? He who turns on his heels will not 
[Page 35, Line 22] harm Allah in any way. And Allah will re-
[Page 35, Line 23] ward the appreciative.  
[Page 35, Line 24] 145. No soul can die except by Allah’s leave, at 
[Page 35, Line 25] a predetermined time. Whoever desires the 
[Page 35, Line 26] reward of the world, We will give him some 
[Page 35, Line 27] of it; and whoever desires the reward of the 
[Page 35, Line 28] Hereafter, We will give him some of it; and 
[Page 35, Line 29] We will reward the appreciative.  
[Page 35, Line 30] 146. How  many a prophet fought alongside 
[Page 35, Line 31] him numerous godly people? They did not 
[Page 35, Line 32] waver for what afflicted them in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they give 
[Page 35, Line 33] in. Allah loves those who endure.  
[Page 35, Line 34] 147. Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive 
[Page 35, Line 35] us our off ences, and our excesses in our con-
[Page 35, Line 36] duct, and strengthen our foothold, and help 
[Page 35, Line 37] us against the disbelieving people.”  
[Page 35, Line 38] 148. So Allah gave them the reward of this 
[Page 35, Line 39] world, and the excellent reward of the Here-
[Page 35, Line 40] after. Allah loves the doers of good.  
[Page 35, Line 41] 149. O you who be lieve! If you obey those who 
[Page 35, Line 42] disbelieve, they will turn you back on your 
[Page 35, Line 43] heels, and you end up losers.  150. Allah is your Master, and He is the Best of 
[Page 35, Line 44] Helpers.  
[Page 35, Line 45] 151. We will throw terror into the hearts of 
[Page 35, Line 46] those who disbelieve, because they attribute 
[Page 35, Line 47] to Al lah partners for which He revealed no 
[Page 35, Line 48] sanction. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable 
[Page 35, Line 49] is the lodging of the evildoers.  
[Page 35, Line 50] 152. Allah has fulfilled His promise to you, and 
[Page 35, Line 51] you defeated them by His leave; until when 
[Page 35, Line 52] you faltered, and disputed the command, and 
[Page 35, Line 53] disobeyed after He had shown you what you 
[Page 35, Line 54] like. Some of you want this world, and some 
[Page 35, Line 55] of you want the next. Then He turned you 
[Page 35, Line 56] away from them, to test you; but He par-
[Page 35, Line 57] doned you. Allah is Gracious towards the be-
[Page 35, Line 58] lievers.  
[Page 35, Line 59] 153. Remember when you fled, not caring for 
[Page 35, Line 60] anyone, even though the Messenger was call-
[Page 35, Line 61] ing you from your rear. Then He repaid you with sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would 
[Page 35, Line 62] not grieve over what you missed, or for what 
[Page 35, Line 63] afflicted you. Allah is Informed of what you 
[Page 35, Line 64] do. 
[Page 35, Line 65] 154. Then after the setback, H e sent down se-
[Page 35, Line 66] curity upon you. Slumber overcame some of 
[Page 35, Line 67] you, while others cared only for themselves, thinking of Allah thoughts that were un-
[Page 35, Line 68] true—thoughts of ignorance —saying, “Is an-
[Page 35, Line 69] ything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to Al-
[Page 35, Line 70] lah.” They conceal within the mselves what 
[Page 35, Line 71] they do not reveal to you. And they say, “If it was up to us, none of us would have been 
[Page 35, Line 72] killed here.” Say, “Even if you Had stayed in 
[Page 35, Line 73] your homes, those destined to be killed would 
[Page 35, Line 74] have marched into their death beds.” Allah 
[Page 35, Line 75] thus tests what is in your minds, and purifies 
[Page 35, Line 76] what is in your hearts. Allah knows what the 
[Page 35, Line 77] hearts contain.  
[Page 35, Line 78] 155. Those of you who turned back on the day 
[Page 35, Line 79] when the two armies clashed —it was Satan 
[Page 35, Line 80] who caused them to backslide, on account of 
[Page 35, Line 81] some of what they have earned. But Al lah has 
[Page 35, Line 82] forgiven them. Allah is Forgiving and Pru-dent.  
[Page 35, Line 83] 156. O you who believe! Do not be like those 
[Page 35, Line 84] who disbelieved, and said of their brethren 
[Page 35, Line 85] 24 
[Page 36, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 36, Line 2] who marched in the land, or went on the of-
[Page 36, Line 3] fensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would 
[Page 36, Line 4] not have died or been ki lled.” So that Allah 
[Page 36, Line 5] may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. 
[Page 36, Line 6] Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is See-
[Page 36, Line 7] ing of what you do.  
[Page 36, Line 8] 157. If you are killed in the cause of Allah, or 
[Page 36, Line 9] die— forgiveness and mercy from Allah are 
[Page 36, Line 10] better than what they hoard.  
[Page 36, Line 11] 158. If you die, or are killed —to Allah you will 
[Page 36, Line 12] be gathered up.  
[Page 36, Line 13] 159. It is by of grace from Allah that you were 
[Page 36, Line 14] gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard-
[Page 36, Line 15] hearted, they would have dispersed from 
[Page 36, Line 16] around you. So pardon them, and ask for-
[Page 36, Line 17] giveness for them, and c onsult them in the 
[Page 36, Line 18] conduct of affairs. And when you make a de-
[Page 36, Line 19] cision, put your trust in Allah; Allah loves the 
[Page 36, Line 20] trusting.  
[Page 36, Line 21] 160. If Allah supports you, there is none who 
[Page 36, Line 22] can overcome you. But if He fails you, who is 
[Page 36, Line 23] there to help you after Him? So in Allah let  
[Page 36, Line 24] the believers put their trust.  
[Page 36, Line 25] 161. It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. 
[Page 36, Line 26] Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dis-honesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then 
[Page 36, Line 27] every soul will be paid in full for what it has 
[Page 36, Line 28] earned, and they will not be wronged.  
[Page 36, Line 29] 162. Is someone who pursues Allah's approval 
[Page 36, Line 30] the same as someone who incurs Allah's 
[Page 36, Line 31] wrath and his refuge is Hell —the miserable 
[Page 36, Line 32] destination?  
[Page 36, Line 33] 163. They have different ranks with Allah, and 
[Page 36, Line 34] Allah is Seeing of what they do.  
[Page 36, Line 35] 164. Allah has blessed the believers, as He 
[Page 36, Line 36] raised up among them a messenger from 
[Page 36, Line 37] among themselves, who recites to them His 
[Page 36, Line 38] revelations, and purifies them, and teaches 
[Page 36, Line 39] them the Scripture and wisdom; although be-
[Page 36, Line 40] fore that they were in evident error.  
[Page 36, Line 41] 165. And when a calamity befell you, even after 
[Page 36, Line 42] you had inflicted twice as much, you said, 
[Page 36, Line 43] “How is this?” Say, “It is from your own selves.” Allah is Able to do all things.  166. What befell you on the day the two armies 
[Page 36, Line 44] clashed was with Allah’s permission; that He 
[Page 36, Line 45] may know the believers.  
[Page 36, Line 46] 167. And that He  may know the hypocrites. 
[Page 36, Line 47] And it was said to them, “Come, fight in the 
[Page 36, Line 48] cause of Allah, or contribute.” They said, “If 
[Page 36, Line 49] we knew how to fight, we would have fol-
[Page 36, Line 50] lowed you.” On that day they were closer to 
[Page 36, Line 51] infidelity than they were to faith. They say 
[Page 36, Line 52] with their  mouths what is not in their hearts; 
[Page 36, Line 53] but Allah knows what they hide.  
[Page 36, Line 54] 168. Those who said of their brethren, as they 
[Page 36, Line 55] stayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.” Say, “Then avert 
[Page 36, Line 56] death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 36, Line 57] 169. Do not consider those killed in the cause 
[Page 36, Line 58] of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their 
[Page 36, Line 59] Lord, well provided for.  
[Page 36, Line 60] 170. Delighting in what Allah has given them 
[Page 36, Line 61] out of His grace, and happy for those who have not yet joined them; that they have 
[Page 36, Line 62] nothing to f ear, nor will they grieve.  
[Page 36, Line 63] 171. They rejoice in grace from Allah, and 
[Page 36, Line 64] bounty, and that Allah will not waste the re-
[Page 36, Line 65] ward of the faithful.  
[Page 36, Line 66] 172. Those who responded to Allah and the 
[Page 36, Line 67] Messenger, despite the persecution they had 
[Page 36, Line 68] suffered. For the virtuous and the  pious 
[Page 36, Line 69] among them is a great reward.  
[Page 36, Line 70] 173. Those to whom the people have said, “The 
[Page 36, Line 71] people have mobilized against you, so fear them.” But this only increased them in faith, and they said, “Allah is enough for us; He is 
[Page 36, Line 72] the Excellent Protector.”  
[Page 36, Line 73] 174. So they  came back with grace from Allah, 
[Page 36, Line 74] and bounty, and no harm having touched them. They pursued what pleases Allah. Al-
[Page 36, Line 75] lah possesses immense grace.  
[Page 36, Line 76] 175. That is only Satan frightening his parti-
[Page 36, Line 77] sans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you 
[Page 36, Line 78] are believers.  
[Page 36, Line 79] 176. And do not be saddened by those who 
[Page 36, Line 80] rush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah 
[Page 36, Line 81] in the least. Allah desires to give them no 
[Page 36, Line 82] 25 
[Page 37, Line 1] 3.  FAMILY OF IMRAN   (Ali ‘Imran)  
[Page 37, Line 2] share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment 
[Page 37, Line 3] awaits them.  
[Page 37, Line 4] 177. Those who exchange blasphemy for faith 
[Page 37, Line 5] will not harm Allah in the leas t. A painful tor-
[Page 37, Line 6] ment awaits them.  
[Page 37, Line 7] 178. Those who disbelieve should not assume 
[Page 37, Line 8] that We respite them for their own good. In 
[Page 37, Line 9] fact, We only respite them so that they may 
[Page 37, Line 10] increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment 
[Page 37, Line 11] awaits them.  
[Page 37, Line 12] 179. Allah will not leave the b elievers as you 
[Page 37, Line 13] are, without distinguishing the wicked from 
[Page 37, Line 14] the sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the future, but Allah elects from among His mes-
[Page 37, Line 15] sengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah 
[Page 37, Line 16] and His messengers. If you believe and prac-
[Page 37, Line 17] tice piety, you will have a splendid reward.  
[Page 37, Line 18] 180. Those who withhold what Allah has given 
[Page 37, Line 19] them of his bounty should not assume that is 
[Page 37, Line 20] good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their hoardings on 
[Page 37, Line 21] the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the 
[Page 37, Line 22] inherit ance of the heavens and the earth, and 
[Page 37, Line 23] Allah is well acquainted with what you do.  
[Page 37, Line 24] 181. Allah has heard the statement of those 
[Page 37, Line 25] who said, “Allah is poor, and we are rich.” We will write down what they said, and their wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will 
[Page 37, Line 26] say, “Taste the torment of the burning.”  
[Page 37, Line 27] 182. “This is on account of what your hands 
[Page 37, Line 28] have forwarded, and because Allah is not un-
[Page 37, Line 29] just towards the creatures.”  
[Page 37, Line 30] 183. Those who said, “Allah has made a cove-
[Page 37, Line 31] nant with us, that we shall not believe in any 
[Page 37, Line 32] mess enger unless he brings us an offering to 
[Page 37, Line 33] be consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have 
[Page 37, Line 34] come to you before me with proofs, and with 
[Page 37, Line 35] what you asked for; so why did you assassi-
[Page 37, Line 36] nate them, if you are truthful?”  
[Page 37, Line 37] 184. If they accuse you of lying, messengers be-
[Page 37, Line 38] fore you were accused of lying. They came 
[Page 37, Line 39] with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illu-minating Scripture.  
[Page 37, Line 40] 185. Every soul will have a taste of death, and 
[Page 37, Line 41] you will receive your recompense on the Day 
[Page 37, Line 42] of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted  to Paradise, has won. The 
[Page 37, Line 43] life of this world is merely enjoyment of de-lusion.  
[Page 37, Line 44] 186. You will be tested through your posses-
[Page 37, Line 45] sions and your persons; and you will hear 
[Page 37, Line 46] from those who received the Scripture before 
[Page 37, Line 47] you, and from the idol worshipers, much 
[Page 37, Line 48] abuse. But if you persevere and lead a right-
[Page 37, Line 49] eous life— that indeed is a mark of great de-
[Page 37, Line 50] term ination.  
[Page 37, Line 51] 187. Allah received a pledge from those who 
[Page 37, Line 52] were given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim it to the people, and not conceal it.” But they 
[Page 37, Line 53] disregarded it behind their backs, and ex-
[Page 37, Line 54] changed it for a small price. What a miserable 
[Page 37, Line 55] exchange they made.  
[Page 37, Line 56] 188. Do not think that those who rejoice in 
[Page 37, Line 57] what they have done, and love to be praised 
[Page 37, Line 58] for what they have not done —do not think 
[Page 37, Line 59] they can evade the punishment. They will 
[Page 37, Line 60] have a painful punishment.  
[Page 37, Line 61] 189. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the 
[Page 37, Line 62] heavens and th e earth. Allah has power over 
[Page 37, Line 63] all things.  
[Page 37, Line 64] 190. In the creation of the heavens and the 
[Page 37, Line 65] earth, and in the alternation of night and day, 
[Page 37, Line 66] are signs for people of understanding.  
[Page 37, Line 67] 191. Those who remember Allah while stand-
[Page 37, Line 68] ing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they 
[Page 37, Line 69] reflect upon the creation of the heavens and 
[Page 37, Line 70] the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this 
[Page 37, Line 71] in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the 
[Page 37, Line 72] punishment of the Fire.”  
[Page 37, Line 73] 192. “Our Lord, whomever You commit to the 
[Page 37, Line 74] Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers 
[Page 37, Line 75] will have no helpers.”  
[Page 37, Line 76] 193. “Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling 
[Page 37, Line 77] to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,' and we 
[Page 37, Line 78] have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit our misdeeds, and make us die in 
[Page 37, Line 79] the company of the virtuous.”  
[Page 37, Line 80] 194. “Our Lord, and give us  what You have 
[Page 37, Line 81] promised us through Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 37, Line 82] tion. Surely You never break a promise.”  
[Page 37, Line 83] 26 
[Page 38, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 38, Line 2] 195. And so their Lord answered them: “I will 
[Page 38, Line 3] not waste the work of any worker among you, 
[Page 38, Line 4] whether male or female. You are one of an-
[Page 38, Line 5] other. For those who emigrated, and were ex-
[Page 38, Line 6] pelled from their homes, and were persecuted 
[Page 38, Line 7] because of Me, and fought and were killed —
[Page 38, Line 8] I will remit for them their sins, and will admit 
[Page 38, Line 9] them into gardens beneath which rivers 
[Page 38, Line 10] flow —a reward from Allah.  With Allah is the 
[Page 38, Line 11] ultimate reward.”  
[Page 38, Line 12] 196. Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ 
[Page 38, Line 13] movements in the land.  
[Page 38, Line 14] 197. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is 
[Page 38, Line 15] Hell. What a miserable resort.  
[Page 38, Line 16] 198. As for those who feared their Lord: for 
[Page 38, Line 17] them will be gardens beneath w hich rivers 
[Page 38, Line 18] flow, wherein they will abide forever —hospi-
[Page 38, Line 19] tality from Allah. What Allah possesses is 
[Page 38, Line 20] best for the just.  
[Page 38, Line 21] 199. Among the People of the Scripture are 
[Page 38, Line 22] those who believe in Allah, and in what was 
[Page 38, Line 23] revealed to you, and in what was revealed to 
[Page 38, Line 24] them. T hey are humble before Allah, and 
[Page 38, Line 25] they do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap 
[Page 38, Line 26] price. These will have their reward with their 
[Page 38, Line 27] Lord. Allah is swift in reckoning.  
[Page 38, Line 28] 200. O you who believe! Be patient, and advo-
[Page 38, Line 29] cate patience, and be united, and revere Al-
[Page 38, Line 30] lah, so that you may thrive.  

[Page 38, Line 32] 4. WOMEN  
[Page 38, Line 33] (an-Nisa’ ) 
[Page 38, Line 34] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 38, Line 35] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 38, Line 36] 1. O people! Fear your Lord, who created you 
[Page 38, Line 37] from a single soul, and created from it its 
[Page 38, Line 38] mate, and propagated from them many men and women. And revere Allah whom  you ask 
[Page 38, Line 39] about, and the parents. Surely, Allah is 
[Page 38, Line 40] Watchful over you.  
[Page 38, Line 41] 2. And give orphans their properties, and do 
[Page 38, Line 42] not substitute the bad for the good. And do 
[Page 38, Line 43] not consume their properties by combining 
[Page 38, Line 44] them with yours, for that would be a serious 
[Page 38, Line 45] sin. 3. If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the 
[Page 38, Line 46] orphans —then marry the women you like —
[Page 38, Line 47] two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will 
[Page 38, Line 48] not be fair, then one, or what you already 
[Page 38, Line 49] have. That makes it more likely that you 
[Page 38, Line 50] avoid bias.  
[Page 38, Line 51] 4. Give women their dowries gr aciously. But if 
[Page 38, Line 52] they willingly forego some of it, then con-
[Page 38, Line 53] sume it with enjoyment and pleasure.  
[Page 38, Line 54] 5. Do not give the immature your money 
[Page 38, Line 55] which Allah has assigned to you for support. 
[Page 38, Line 56] But provide for them from it, and clothe 
[Page 38, Line 57] them, and speak to them with kind w ords.  
[Page 38, Line 58] 6. Test the orphans until they reach the age of 
[Page 38, Line 59] marriage. If you find them to be mature 
[Page 38, Line 60] enough, hand over their properties to them. And do not consume it extravagantly or hast-
[Page 38, Line 61] ily before they grow up. The rich shall not 
[Page 38, Line 62] charge any wage, but the poor m ay charge 
[Page 38, Line 63] fairly. When you hand over their properties 
[Page 38, Line 64] to them, have it witnessed for them. Allah 
[Page 38, Line 65] suffices as a Reckoner.  
[Page 38, Line 66] 7. Men receive a share of what their parents 
[Page 38, Line 67] and relatives leave, and women receive a 
[Page 38, Line 68] share of what their parents and relatives 
[Page 38, Line 69] leave; be it little or much —a legal share.  
[Page 38, Line 70] 8. If the distribution is attended by the rela-
[Page 38, Line 71] tives, and the orphans, and the needy, give 
[Page 38, Line 72] them something out of it, and speak to them 
[Page 38, Line 73] kindly.  
[Page 38, Line 74] 9. Those who are concerned about the fate of 
[Page 38, Line 75] their weak children, in case they  leave them 
[Page 38, Line 76] behind, should fear Allah, and speak appro-priate words.  
[Page 38, Line 77] 10. Those who consume the wealth of orphans 
[Page 38, Line 78] illicitly consume only fire into their bellies; 
[Page 38, Line 79] and they will roast in a Blaze.  
[Page 38, Line 80] 11. Allah instructs you regarding your chil-
[Page 38, Line 81] dren: The male receiv es the equivalent of the 
[Page 38, Line 82] share of two females. If they are daughters, 
[Page 38, Line 83] more than two, they get two- thirds of what he 
[Page 38, Line 84] leaves. If there is only one, she gets one -half. 
[Page 38, Line 85] As for the parents, each gets one -sixth of 
[Page 38, Line 86] what he leaves, if he had children. If he had 
[Page 38, Line 87] no children, and his parents inherit from 
[Page 38, Line 88] 27 
[Page 39, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 39, Line 2] him, his mother gets one -third. If he has sib-
[Page 39, Line 3] lings, his mother gets one -sixth. After ful-
[Page 39, Line 4] filling any bequest and paying off debts. Your 
[Page 39, Line 5] parents and your children— you do not know 
[Page 39, Line 6] which are closer to you in welfare. Thi s is Al-
[Page 39, Line 7] lah's Law. Allah is Knowing and Judicious.  
[Page 39, Line 8] 12. You get one -half of what your wives leave 
[Page 39, Line 9] behind, if they had no children. If they had 
[Page 39, Line 10] children, you get one -fourth of what they 
[Page 39, Line 11] leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying 
[Page 39, Line 12] off debts. They get one- fourth of what you 
[Page 39, Line 13] leave behind, if you have no children. If you 
[Page 39, Line 14] have children, they get one- eighth of what 
[Page 39, Line 15] you leave. After fulfilling any bequest and 
[Page 39, Line 16] paying off debts. If a man or woman leaves 
[Page 39, Line 17] neither parents nor children, but has a 
[Page 39, Line 18] brother or sister, each of them gets one -sixth. 
[Page 39, Line 19] If there are more siblings, they share one-
[Page 39, Line 20] third. After fulfilling any bequest and paying 
[Page 39, Line 21] off debts, without any prejudice. This is a will 
[Page 39, Line 22] from Allah. Allah is Knowing and Clement.  
[Page 39, Line 23] 13. These are the bounds set by Allah. Who-
[Page 39, Line 24] ever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will 
[Page 39, Line 25] admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers 
[Page 39, Line 26] flow, to abide therein forever. That is the 
[Page 39, Line 27] great attainment.  
[Page 39, Line 28] 14. But whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes-
[Page 39, Line 29] senger, and oversteps His bounds, He will ad-mit him into a Fire, wherein  he abides for-
[Page 39, Line 30] ever, and he will have a shameful punish-
[Page 39, Line 31] ment.  
[Page 39, Line 32] 15. Those of your women who commit lewd-
[Page 39, Line 33] ness, you must have four witnesses against 
[Page 39, Line 34] them, from among you. If they testify, con-
[Page 39, Line 35] fine them to the homes until death claims 
[Page 39, Line 36] them, or Allah makes a way for  them.  
[Page 39, Line 37] 16. If two men among you commit it, punish 
[Page 39, Line 38] them both. But if they repent and reform, 
[Page 39, Line 39] leave them alone. Allah is Redeemer, Full of 
[Page 39, Line 40] Mercy.  
[Page 39, Line 41] 17. Repentance is available from Allah for 
[Page 39, Line 42] those who commit evil out of ignorance, and 
[Page 39, Line 43] then repent soon after. These —Allah will re-
[Page 39, Line 44] lent towards them. Allah is Knowing and 
[Page 39, Line 45] Wise.  18. But repentance is not available for those 
[Page 39, Line 46] who commit evils, until when death ap-
[Page 39, Line 47] proaches one of them, he says, “Now I re-
[Page 39, Line 48] pent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers. 
[Page 39, Line 49] These —We have prepared  for them a painful 
[Page 39, Line 50] torment.  
[Page 39, Line 51] 19. O you who believe! It is not permitted for 
[Page 39, Line 52] you to inherit women against their will. And do not coerce them in order to take away 
[Page 39, Line 53] some of what you had given them, unless they 
[Page 39, Line 54] commit a proven adultery. And live with 
[Page 39, Line 55] them in k indness. If you dislike them, it may 
[Page 39, Line 56] be that you dislike something in which Allah 
[Page 39, Line 57] has placed much good.  
[Page 39, Line 58] 20. If you wish to replace one wife with an-
[Page 39, Line 59] other, and you have given one of them a for-
[Page 39, Line 60] tune, take nothing back from it. Would you 
[Page 39, Line 61] take it back fraudulent ly and sinfully?  
[Page 39, Line 62] 21. And how can you take it back, when you 
[Page 39, Line 63] have been intimate with one another, and 
[Page 39, Line 64] they have received from you a solid commit-
[Page 39, Line 65] ment?  
[Page 39, Line 66] 22. Do not marry women whom your fathers 
[Page 39, Line 67] married, except what is already past. That is 
[Page 39, Line 68] improper, indecent, and a bad custom.  
[Page 39, Line 69] 23. Forbidden for you are your mothers, your 
[Page 39, Line 70] daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, your brother's daugh-
[Page 39, Line 71] ters, your sister's daughters, your foster -
[Page 39, Line 72] mothers who nursed you, your sisters 
[Page 39, Line 73] through nursing, your wives' mothers, and 
[Page 39, Line 74] your stepdaughters in your guardianship —
[Page 39, Line 75] born of wives you have gone into —but if you 
[Page 39, Line 76] have not gone into them, there is no blame on 
[Page 39, Line 77] you. And the wives of your genetic sons, and 
[Page 39, Line 78] marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except what is past. All ah is Oft -Forgiving, Most 
[Page 39, Line 79] Merciful.  
[Page 39, Line 80] 24. And all married women, except those you 
[Page 39, Line 81] rightfully possess. This is Allah’s decree, 
[Page 39, Line 82] binding upon you. Permitted for you are 
[Page 39, Line 83] those that lie outside these limits, provided 
[Page 39, Line 84] you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts 
[Page 39, Line 85] from your property, seeking wedlock, not 
[Page 39, Line 86] prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then give them their dowry —a legal obligation. 
[Page 39, Line 87] You commit no error by agreeing to any 
[Page 39, Line 88] 28 
[Page 40, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 40, Line 2] change to the dowry. Allah is All -Knowing, 
[Page 40, Line 3] Most Wise.  
[Page 40, Line 4] 25. If any of you lack the means to marry free 
[Page 40, Line 5] believing women, he may marry one of the 
[Page 40, Line 6] believing maids under your control. Allah is 
[Page 40, Line 7] well aware of your faith. You are from one 
[Page 40, Line 8] another. Marry them with the permission of their guardians, and give them their recom-pense fairly —to be protected —neither com-
[Page 40, Line 9] mitting adultery, nor taking secret lovers. When they are married, if they commit adul-
[Page 40, Line 10] tery, their punishment shall be half that of 
[Page 40, Line 11] free women. That is for those among you who 
[Page 40, Line 12] fear falling into decadence. But to practice 
[Page 40, Line 13] self-restraint is better fo r you. Allah is Most 
[Page 40, Line 14] Forgiving, Most Merciful.  
[Page 40, Line 15] 26. Allah intends to make things clear to you, 
[Page 40, Line 16] and to guide you in the ways of those before you, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Know-
[Page 40, Line 17] ing, Most Wise.  
[Page 40, Line 18] 27. Allah intends to redeem you, but those 
[Page 40, Line 19] who follow their  desires want you to turn 
[Page 40, Line 20] away utterly.  
[Page 40, Line 21] 28. Allah intends to lighten your burden, for 
[Page 40, Line 22] the human being was created weak.  
[Page 40, Line 23] 29. O you who believe! Do not consume each 
[Page 40, Line 24] other’s wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual 
[Page 40, Line 25] consent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah 
[Page 40, Line 26] is Merciful towards you.  
[Page 40, Line 27] 30. Whoever does that, out of hostility and 
[Page 40, Line 28] wrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire. 
[Page 40, Line 29] And that would be easy for Allah.  
[Page 40, Line 30] 31. If you avoid the worst of what you are for-
[Page 40, Line 31] bidden, We will remit your sins, and admit 
[Page 40, Line 32] you by a Gate of Honor . 
[Page 40, Line 33] 32. Do not covet what Allah has given to some 
[Page 40, Line 34] of you in preference to others. For men is a 
[Page 40, Line 35] share of what they have earned, and for 
[Page 40, Line 36] women is a share of what they have earned. 
[Page 40, Line 37] And ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has 
[Page 40, Line 38] knowledge of everything.  
[Page 40, Line 39] 33. To everyone We have assigned beneficiar-
[Page 40, Line 40] ies in what is left by parents and relatives. 
[Page 40, Line 41] Those with whom you have made an agree-
[Page 40, Line 42] ment, give them their share. Allah is Witness 
[Page 40, Line 43] over all things.  34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of 
[Page 40, Line 44] women, as Allah has given some of th em an 
[Page 40, Line 45] advantage over others, and because they 
[Page 40, Line 46] spend out of their wealth. The good women 
[Page 40, Line 47] are obedient, guarding what Allah would 
[Page 40, Line 48] have them guard. As for those from whom 
[Page 40, Line 49] you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and 
[Page 40, Line 50] abandon them in their beds, then strike them. 
[Page 40, Line 51] But if they obey you, seek no way against 
[Page 40, Line 52] them. Allah is Sublime, Great.  
[Page 40, Line 53] 35. If you fear a breach between the two, ap-
[Page 40, Line 54] point an arbiter from his family and an arbi-ter from her family. If they wish to reconcile, 
[Page 40, Line 55] Allah will bring them together. Allah is 
[Page 40, Line 56] Knowledgeable, Expert.  
[Page 40, Line 57] 36. Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to 
[Page 40, Line 58] Him, and be good to the parents, and the rel-
[Page 40, Line 59] atives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the neighbor next door, and the distant neighbor, 
[Page 40, Line 60] and the close associate, and the traveler, and 
[Page 40, Line 61] your servan ts. Allah does not love the arro-
[Page 40, Line 62] gant showoff.  
[Page 40, Line 63] 37. Those who are stingy, and exhort people to 
[Page 40, Line 64] stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given them from His bounty. We have prepared for 
[Page 40, Line 65] the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.  
[Page 40, Line 66] 38. And those who spend their money to be 
[Page 40, Line 67] seen by people, and believe neither in Allah 
[Page 40, Line 68] nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a companion —what an evil companion.  
[Page 40, Line 69] 39. What would they have lost, had they be-
[Page 40, Line 70] lieved in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out 
[Page 40, Line 71] of what Allah has provided for the m? Allah 
[Page 40, Line 72] knows them very well.  
[Page 40, Line 73] 40. Allah does not commit an atom's weight of 
[Page 40, Line 74] injustice; and if there is a good deed, He dou-bles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime 
[Page 40, Line 75] compensation.  
[Page 40, Line 76] 41. Then how will it be, when We bring a wit-
[Page 40, Line 77] ness from every community, and We bring you as a witness against these?  
[Page 40, Line 78] 42. On that Day, those who disbelieved and 
[Page 40, Line 79] disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the 
[Page 40, Line 80] earth were leveled over them. They will con-
[Page 40, Line 81] ceal nothing from Allah.  
[Page 40, Line 82] 29 
[Page 41, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 41, Line 2] 43. O you who believe! Do not approach the 
[Page 41, Line 3] prayer while yo u are drunk, so that you know 
[Page 41, Line 4] what you say; nor after sexual orgasm —un-
[Page 41, Line 5] less you are travelling —until you have 
[Page 41, Line 6] bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of 
[Page 41, Line 7] you comes from the toilet, or you have had 
[Page 41, Line 8] intercourse with women, and cannot find 
[Page 41, Line 9] water, find cle an sand and wipe your faces 
[Page 41, Line 10] and your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning 
[Page 41, Line 11] and Forgiving.  
[Page 41, Line 12] 44. Have you not considered those who were 
[Page 41, Line 13] given a share of the Book? They buy error, 
[Page 41, Line 14] and wish you would lose the way.  
[Page 41, Line 15] 45. But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah 
[Page 41, Line 16] is suf ficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi-
[Page 41, Line 17] cient as a Supporter.  
[Page 41, Line 18] 46. Among the Jews are some who take words 
[Page 41, Line 19] out of context, and say, “We hear and we dis-
[Page 41, Line 20] obey”, and “Hear without listening”, and “Observe us,” twisting with their tongues and 
[Page 41, Line 21] slandering the rel igion. Had they said, “We 
[Page 41, Line 22] hear and we obey”, and “Listen”, and “Give 
[Page 41, Line 23] us your attention,” it would have been better 
[Page 41, Line 24] for them, and more upright. But Allah has 
[Page 41, Line 25] cursed them for their disbelief; they do not 
[Page 41, Line 26] believe except a little.  
[Page 41, Line 27] 47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in 
[Page 41, Line 28] what We sent down, confirming what you 
[Page 41, Line 29] have, before We obliterate faces and turn them inside out, or curse them as We cursed 
[Page 41, Line 30] the Sabbath- breakers. The command of Allah 
[Page 41, Line 31] is always done.  
[Page 41, Line 32] 48. Allah does not forgive association with 
[Page 41, Line 33] Him, but He  forgives anything less than that 
[Page 41, Line 34] to whomever He wills. Whoever associates 
[Page 41, Line 35] anything with Allah has devised a monstrous 
[Page 41, Line 36] sin. 
[Page 41, Line 37] 49. Have you not considered those who claim 
[Page 41, Line 38] purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies 
[Page 41, Line 39] whom He wills, and they will not be wronge d 
[Page 41, Line 40] a whit.  
[Page 41, Line 41] 50. See how they devise lies against Allah. That 
[Page 41, Line 42] alone is an outright sin.  
[Page 41, Line 43] 51. Have you not considered those who were 
[Page 41, Line 44] given a share of the Book? They believe in su-
[Page 41, Line 45] perstition and evil powers, and say of those who disbelieve, “These are better guided on 
[Page 41, Line 46] the way than the believers.”  
[Page 41, Line 47] 52. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. 
[Page 41, Line 48] Whomever Allah curses, you will find no sav-
[Page 41, Line 49] ior for him.  
[Page 41, Line 50] 53. Or do they own a share of the kingdom? 
[Page 41, Line 51] Then they would not give people a speck.  
[Page 41, Line 52] 54. Or do they envy the people for what Allah 
[Page 41, Line 53] has given them of His grace? We have given 
[Page 41, Line 54] the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom, 
[Page 41, Line 55] and We have given them a great kingdom.  
[Page 41, Line 56] 55. Among them are those who believed in it, 
[Page 41, Line 57] and among them are those who held back from it. Hell is a sufficient Infer no. 
[Page 41, Line 58] 56. Those who reject Our revelations —We will 
[Page 41, Line 59] scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins 
[Page 41, Line 60] are cooked, We will replace them with other 
[Page 41, Line 61] skins, so they will experience the suffering. 
[Page 41, Line 62] Allah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.  
[Page 41, Line 63] 57. As for those who believe and do good 
[Page 41, Line 64] deeds, We will admit them into Gardens be-
[Page 41, Line 65] neath which rivers flow, abiding therein for-ever. They will have purified spouses therein, 
[Page 41, Line 66] and We will admit them into a shady shade.  
[Page 41, Line 67] 58. Allah instructs you to give back things en-
[Page 41, Line 68] trusted to you to their owners . And when you 
[Page 41, Line 69] judge between people, judge with justice. Al-
[Page 41, Line 70] lah’s instructions to you are excellent. Allah 
[Page 41, Line 71] is All -Hearing, All -Seeing.  
[Page 41, Line 72] 59. O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey 
[Page 41, Line 73] the Messenger and those in authority among 
[Page 41, Line 74] you. And if you dispute over anythin g, refer 
[Page 41, Line 75] it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe 
[Page 41, Line 76] in Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a 
[Page 41, Line 77] most excellent determination.  
[Page 41, Line 78] 60. Have you not observed those who claim 
[Page 41, Line 79] that they believe in what was revealed to you, 
[Page 41, Line 80] and in what was revealed before you , yet they 
[Page 41, Line 81] seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of being commanded to reject them? Satan 
[Page 41, Line 82] means to mislead them far away.  
[Page 41, Line 83] 61. And when it is said to them, “Come to what 
[Page 41, Line 84] Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,” 
[Page 41, Line 85] you see the hypocrites shunning you  com-
[Page 41, Line 86] pletely.  
[Page 41, Line 87] 30 
[Page 42, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 42, Line 2] 62. How about when a disaster strikes them 
[Page 42, Line 3] because what their hands have put forward, 
[Page 42, Line 4] and then they come to you swearing by Allah: 
[Page 42, Line 5] “We only intended goodwill and reconcilia-
[Page 42, Line 6] tion”?  
[Page 42, Line 7] 63. They are those whom Allah knows what is 
[Page 42, Line 8] in their hearts. So ignore them, and admon-
[Page 42, Line 9] ish them, and say to them concerning them-
[Page 42, Line 10] selves penetrating words.  
[Page 42, Line 11] 64. We did not send any messenger except to 
[Page 42, Line 12] be obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when 
[Page 42, Line 13] they wronged themselves, come to you, and prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes-
[Page 42, Line 14] senger had prayed for their forgiveness, they 
[Page 42, Line 15] would have found Allah Relenting and Mer-
[Page 42, Line 16] ciful.  
[Page 42, Line 17] 65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe 
[Page 42, Line 18] until they call you to arbitrate in their dis-
[Page 42, Line 19] putes, and then find within themselves no re-sentment regarding your decisions, and sub-
[Page 42, Line 20] mit themselves completely.  
[Page 42, Line 21] 66. Had We decreed for them: “Kill your-
[Page 42, Line 22] selves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But 
[Page 42, Line 23] had they done what they were instructed to 
[Page 42, Line 24] do, it would have been better for  them, and a 
[Page 42, Line 25] firmer confirmation.  
[Page 42, Line 26] 67. And We would have given them from Our 
[Page 42, Line 27] presence a rich compensation.  
[Page 42, Line 28] 68. And We would have guided them on a 
[Page 42, Line 29] straight path.  
[Page 42, Line 30] 69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger —
[Page 42, Line 31] these are with those whom Allah has 
[Page 42, Line 32] blessed —among the prophets, and the sin-
[Page 42, Line 33] cere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel-
[Page 42, Line 34] lent are those as companions.  
[Page 42, Line 35] 70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices 
[Page 42, Line 36] as Knower.  
[Page 42, Line 37] 71. O you who believe! Take your precautions, 
[Page 42, Line 38] and mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto-gether.  
[Page 42, Line 39] 72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then, 
[Page 42, Line 40] when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah 
[Page 42, Line 41] has favored me, that I was not martyred with 
[Page 42, Line 42] them.”  73. But when some bounty from Allah comes 
[Page 42, Line 43] to you, he says —as if no affection existed be-
[Page 42, Line 44] tween you and him —“If only I had be en with 
[Page 42, Line 45] them, I would have achieved a great victory.”  
[Page 42, Line 46] 74. Let those who sell the life of this world for 
[Page 42, Line 47] the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. 
[Page 42, Line 48] Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and 
[Page 42, Line 49] then is killed, or achieves victory, We will 
[Page 42, Line 50] grant him a great comp ensation.  
[Page 42, Line 51] 75. And why would you not fight in the cause 
[Page 42, Line 52] of Allah, and the helpless men, and women, 
[Page 42, Line 53] and children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are oppressive, 
[Page 42, Line 54] and appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro-
[Page 42, Line 55] tector, and appoint for us  from Your Pres-
[Page 42, Line 56] ence a Victor.”  
[Page 42, Line 57] 76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al-
[Page 42, Line 58] lah, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil. 
[Page 42, Line 59] Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.  
[Page 42, Line 60] 77. Have you not considered those who were 
[Page 42, Line 61] told, “Restrain your hands, and perform your 
[Page 42, Line 62] prayers, and spend in regular charity”? But when fighting was ordained for them, a fac-
[Page 42, Line 63] tion of them feared the people as Allah is 
[Page 42, Line 64] ought to be feared, or even more. And they 
[Page 42, Line 65] said, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting 
[Page 42, Line 66] for us? If only You would postpone it for us 
[Page 42, Line 67] for a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of 
[Page 42, Line 68] this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better 
[Page 42, Line 69] for the righteous, and you will not be 
[Page 42, Line 70] wronged one bit.”  
[Page 42, Line 71] 78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up 
[Page 42, Line 72] with you, even if you were in fortified towers. 
[Page 42, Line 73] When a good fortune comes their way, they 
[Page 42, Line 74] say, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor-
[Page 42, Line 75] tune befalls them, they say, “This is from 
[Page 42, Line 76] you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the 
[Page 42, Line 77] matter with these people, that they hardly  un-
[Page 42, Line 78] derstand a thing?  
[Page 42, Line 79] 79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al-
[Page 42, Line 80] lah, and whatever bad happens to you is from 
[Page 42, Line 81] your own self. We sent you to humanity as a 
[Page 42, Line 82] messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.  
[Page 42, Line 83] 80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying 
[Page 42, Line 84] Allah. And whoever turns away —We did not 
[Page 42, Line 85] send you as a watcher over them.  
[Page 42, Line 86] 31 
[Page 43, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 43, Line 2] 81. They profess obedience, but when they 
[Page 43, Line 3] leave your presence, some of them conspire 
[Page 43, Line 4] something contrary to what you said. But Al-
[Page 43, Line 5] lah writes down what they conspire. So avoid 
[Page 43, Line 6] them, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is 
[Page 43, Line 7] Guardian enough.  
[Page 43, Line 8] 82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it 
[Page 43, Line 9] been from any other than Allah, they would 
[Page 43, Line 10] have found in it much discrepancy.  
[Page 43, Line 11] 83. When some news of security or alarm 
[Page 43, Line 12] comes their way, they broadcast it. But had 
[Page 43, Line 13] they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can 
[Page 43, Line 14] draw conclusions from it would have com-
[Page 43, Line 15] prehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing 
[Page 43, Line 16] and mercy upon you, you would have fol-
[Page 43, Line 17] lowed the Devil, except for a few.  
[Page 43, Line 18] 84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re-
[Page 43, Line 19] sponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be-
[Page 43, Line 20] lievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might 
[Page 43, Line 21] of those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in 
[Page 43, Line 22] Might, and More Punishing.  
[Page 43, Line 23] 85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a 
[Page 43, Line 24] share in it, and whoever inte rcedes for an evil 
[Page 43, Line 25] cause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch over everything.  
[Page 43, Line 26] 86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re-
[Page 43, Line 27] spond with a better greeting, or return it. Al-
[Page 43, Line 28] lah keeps count of everything.  
[Page 43, Line 29] 87. Allah —there is no god except He. He will 
[Page 43, Line 30] gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in 
[Page 43, Line 31] which there is no doubt. And who speaks 
[Page 43, Line 32] more truly than Allah?  
[Page 43, Line 33] 88. What is the matter with you, divided into 
[Page 43, Line 34] two factions regarding the hypocrites, when 
[Page 43, Line 35] Allah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac-
[Page 43, Line 36] count of what they did? Do y ou want to guide 
[Page 43, Line 37] those whom Allah has led astray? Whomever 
[Page 43, Line 38] Allah leads astray —you will never find for 
[Page 43, Line 39] him a way.  
[Page 43, Line 40] 89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just 
[Page 43, Line 41] as they disbelieve, so you would become 
[Page 43, Line 42] equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless 
[Page 43, Line 43] they emig rate in the way of Allah. If they turn 
[Page 43, Line 44] away, seize them and execute them wherever you may find them; and do not take from 
[Page 43, Line 45] among them allies or supporters.  
[Page 43, Line 46] 90. Except those who join people with whom 
[Page 43, Line 47] you have a treaty, or those who come to you 
[Page 43, Line 48] reluctant to f ight you or fight their own peo-
[Page 43, Line 49] ple. Had Allah willed, He would have given 
[Page 43, Line 50] them power over you, and they would have 
[Page 43, Line 51] fought you. If they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then 
[Page 43, Line 52] Allah assigns no excuse for you against them.  
[Page 43, Line 53] 91. You will find others who want security 
[Page 43, Line 54] from you, and security from their own peo-ple. But whenever they are tempted into civil 
[Page 43, Line 55] discord, they plunge into it. So if they do not 
[Page 43, Line 56] withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor 
[Page 43, Line 57] restrain their hands, seize them and execu te 
[Page 43, Line 58] them wherever you find them. Against these, 
[Page 43, Line 59] We have given you clear authorization.  
[Page 43, Line 60] 92. Never should a believer kill another be-
[Page 43, Line 61] liever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be-
[Page 43, Line 62] liever by error must set free a believing slave, 
[Page 43, Line 63] and pay compensation to the vict im’s family, 
[Page 43, Line 64] unless they remit it as charity. If the victim 
[Page 43, Line 65] belonged to a people who are hostile to you, 
[Page 43, Line 66] but is a believer, then the compensation is to 
[Page 43, Line 67] free a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo-
[Page 43, Line 68] ple with whom you have a treaty, then com-
[Page 43, Line 69] pensation should  be handed over to his fam-
[Page 43, Line 70] ily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who 
[Page 43, Line 71] lacks the means must fast for two consecutive 
[Page 43, Line 72] months, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah 
[Page 43, Line 73] is All -Knowing, Most Wise.  
[Page 43, Line 74] 93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the 
[Page 43, Line 75] penalty for him i s Hell, where he will remain 
[Page 43, Line 76] forever. And Allah will be angry with him, 
[Page 43, Line 77] and will curse him, and will prepare for him 
[Page 43, Line 78] a terrible punishment.  
[Page 43, Line 79] 94. O you who believe! When you journey in 
[Page 43, Line 80] the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say to him who offers you peac e, “You are not a 
[Page 43, Line 81] believer,” aspiring for the goods of this world. With Allah are abundant riches. You your-
[Page 43, Line 82] selves were like this before, and Allah be-
[Page 43, Line 83] stowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is 
[Page 43, Line 84] well aware of what you do.  
[Page 43, Line 85] 32 
[Page 44, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 44, Line 2] 95. Not equal are the inactive amo ng the be-
[Page 44, Line 3] lievers —except the disabled —and the striv-
[Page 44, Line 4] ers in the cause of Allah with their posses-
[Page 44, Line 5] sions and their persons. Allah prefers the 
[Page 44, Line 6] strivers with their possessions and their per-
[Page 44, Line 7] sons above the inactive, by a degree. But Al-
[Page 44, Line 8] lah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah 
[Page 44, Line 9] favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a 
[Page 44, Line 10] great reward.  
[Page 44, Line 11] 96. Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and 
[Page 44, Line 12] mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 44, Line 13] 97. While the angels are removing the souls of 
[Page 44, Line 14] those who have wronged themselves, they 
[Page 44, Line 15] will say, “What was the matter with you?” 
[Page 44, Line 16] They will say, “We were oppressed in the 
[Page 44, Line 17] land.” They will say, “Was Allah’s earth not 
[Page 44, Line 18] vast enough for you to emigrate in it?” 
[Page 44, Line 19] These —their refuge is Hell. What a wretched 
[Page 44, Line 20] retreat!  
[Page 44, Line 21] 98. Except for the weak among men, and 
[Page 44, Line 22] women, and children who have no means to 
[Page 44, Line 23] act, and no means to find a way out.  
[Page 44, Line 24] 99. These— Allah may well pardon them. Allah 
[Page 44, Line 25] is Pardoning and Forgiving.  
[Page 44, Line 26] 100. Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Al-
[Page 44, Line 27] lah will find on earth many places of refuge, 
[Page 44, Line 28] and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home, emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and 
[Page 44, Line 29] then is overtaken by death, his compensation 
[Page 44, Line 30] falls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merci-
[Page 44, Line 31] ful. 
[Page 44, Line 32] 101. When you travel in the land, there is no 
[Page 44, Line 33] blame on you for shortening the prayers, if 
[Page 44, Line 34] you fea r that the disbelievers may harm you. 
[Page 44, Line 35] The disbelievers are your manifest enemies.  
[Page 44, Line 36] 102. When you are among them, and you stand 
[Page 44, Line 37] to lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand with you, and let them hold their weap-ons. Then, when they have done their pros-
[Page 44, Line 38] trations, let them withdraw to the rear, and 
[Page 44, Line 39] let another group, that have not prayed yet, 
[Page 44, Line 40] come forward and pray with you; and let 
[Page 44, Line 41] them take their precautions and their weap-
[Page 44, Line 42] ons. Those who disbelieve would like you to 
[Page 44, Line 43] neglect your weapons and your equipment, 
[Page 44, Line 44] so they can attack you in a single assault. You 
[Page 44, Line 45] commit no error, if you are hampered by rain or are sick, by putting down your weapons; 
[Page 44, Line 46] but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has pre-
[Page 44, Line 47] pared for the disbelievers a demeaning pun-
[Page 44, Line 48] ishment.  
[Page 44, Line 49] 103. When you have complet ed the prayer, re-
[Page 44, Line 50] member Allah, standing, or sitting, or on 
[Page 44, Line 51] your sides. And when you feel secure, per-
[Page 44, Line 52] form the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for 
[Page 44, Line 53] believers at specific times.  
[Page 44, Line 54] 104. And do not falter in the pursuit of the en-
[Page 44, Line 55] emy. If you are aching, they are a ching as you 
[Page 44, Line 56] are aching, but you expect from Allah what 
[Page 44, Line 57] they cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable 
[Page 44, Line 58] and Wise.  
[Page 44, Line 59] 105. We have revealed to you the Scripture, 
[Page 44, Line 60] with the truth, so that you judge between people in accordance with what Allah has 
[Page 44, Line 61] shown you. And do no t be an advocate for the 
[Page 44, Line 62] traitors.  
[Page 44, Line 63] 106. And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is 
[Page 44, Line 64] Forgiver and Merciful.  
[Page 44, Line 65] 107. And do not argue on behalf of those who 
[Page 44, Line 66] deceive themselves. Allah does not love the 
[Page 44, Line 67] deceitful sinner.  
[Page 44, Line 68] 108. They hide from the people, but they can-
[Page 44, Line 69] not hide from Allah. He is with them, as they 
[Page 44, Line 70] plot by night with words He does not ap-
[Page 44, Line 71] prove. Allah comprehends what they do.  
[Page 44, Line 72] 109. There you are, arguing on their behalf in 
[Page 44, Line 73] the present life, but who will argue with Allah 
[Page 44, Line 74] on their behalf on the Day of Resu rrection? 
[Page 44, Line 75] Or who will be their representative?  
[Page 44, Line 76] 110. Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul, 
[Page 44, Line 77] then implores Allah for forgiveness, will find 
[Page 44, Line 78] Allah Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 44, Line 79] 111. And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against 
[Page 44, Line 80] himself. Allah is Aware and Wise.  
[Page 44, Line 81] 112. And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, 
[Page 44, Line 82] and then blames it on an innocent person, has taken a slander and a clear sin.  
[Page 44, Line 83] 113. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, 
[Page 44, Line 84] and His mercy, a faction of them would have managed to mislead you. But they only m is-
[Page 44, Line 85] lead themselves, and they cannot harm you in 
[Page 44, Line 86] 33 
[Page 45, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 45, Line 2] any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scrip-
[Page 45, Line 3] ture and wisdom, and has taught you what 
[Page 45, Line 4] you did not know. Allah’s goodness towards 
[Page 45, Line 5] you is great.  
[Page 45, Line 6] 114. There is no good in much of their private 
[Page 45, Line 7] counsels, except for  him who advocates char-
[Page 45, Line 8] ity, or kindness, or reconciliation between 
[Page 45, Line 9] people. Whoever does that, seeking Allah’s 
[Page 45, Line 10] approval, We will give him a great compen-
[Page 45, Line 11] sation.  
[Page 45, Line 12] 115. Whoever makes a breach with the Messen-
[Page 45, Line 13] ger, after the guidance has become clear to 
[Page 45, Line 14] him, and f ollows other than the path of the 
[Page 45, Line 15] believers, We will direct him in the direction 
[Page 45, Line 16] he has chosen, and commit him to Hell —
[Page 45, Line 17] what a terrible destination!  
[Page 45, Line 18] 116.  Allah will not forgive that partners be as-
[Page 45, Line 19] sociated with Him; but will forgive anything less than that,  to whomever He wills. Anyone 
[Page 45, Line 20] who ascribes partners to Allah has strayed 
[Page 45, Line 21] into far error.  
[Page 45, Line 22] 117. They invoke in His stead only females. In 
[Page 45, Line 23] fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.  
[Page 45, Line 24] 118. Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will 
[Page 45, Line 25] take to myself my due share of Your serv-ants.”  
[Page 45, Line 26] 119. “And I will mislead them, and I will entice 
[Page 45, Line 27] them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears 
[Page 45, Line 28] of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the 
[Page 45, Line 29] creation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a 
[Page 45, Line 30] lord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a 
[Page 45, Line 31] profound loss.  
[Page 45, Line 32] 120. He promises them, and he raises their ex-
[Page 45, Line 33] pectations, but Satan promises them nothing 
[Page 45, Line 34] but delusions.  
[Page 45, Line 35] 121. These —their place is Hell, and they will 
[Page 45, Line 36] find no escape from it.  
[Page 45, Line 37] 122. But as for those who believe and do right-
[Page 45, Line 38] eous deeds, We will ad mit them into gardens 
[Page 45, Line 39] beneath which rivers flow, where they will 
[Page 45, Line 40] abide forever. The promise of Allah is true —
[Page 45, Line 41] and who is more truthful in speech than Al-
[Page 45, Line 42] lah? 123. It is not in accordance with your wishes, 
[Page 45, Line 43] nor in accordance with the wishes of the Peo-
[Page 45, Line 44] ple of th e Scripture. Whoever works evil will 
[Page 45, Line 45] pay for it, and will not find for himself, be-
[Page 45, Line 46] sides Allah, any protector or savior.  
[Page 45, Line 47] 124. But whoever works righteousness, 
[Page 45, Line 48] whether male or female, and is a believer —
[Page 45, Line 49] those will enter Paradise, and will not be 
[Page 45, Line 50] wronged a whi t. 
[Page 45, Line 51] 125. And who is better in religion than he who 
[Page 45, Line 52] submits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer 
[Page 45, Line 53] of good, and follows the faith of Abraham the Monotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a 
[Page 45, Line 54] friend.  
[Page 45, Line 55] 126. To Allah belongs what is in the heavens 
[Page 45, Line 56] and what is on earth, and Allah encompasses 
[Page 45, Line 57] everything.  
[Page 45, Line 58] 127. They ask you for a ruling about women. 
[Page 45, Line 59] Say, “Allah gives you a ruling about them, 
[Page 45, Line 60] and so does what is stated to you in the Book about widowed women from whom you 
[Page 45, Line 61] withhold what is decreed for them, yet you 
[Page 45, Line 62] desire to marry them, and about helpless chil-
[Page 45, Line 63] dren: that you should treat the orphans 
[Page 45, Line 64] fairly.” Whatever good you do, Allah knows 
[Page 45, Line 65] it. 
[Page 45, Line 66] 128. If a woman fears maltreatment or deser-
[Page 45, Line 67] tion from her husband, there is no fault in 
[Page 45, Line 68] them if they reconcile their differences, fo r 
[Page 45, Line 69] reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to ava-
[Page 45, Line 70] rice; yet if you do what is good, and practice 
[Page 45, Line 71] piety —Allah is Cognizant of what you do.  
[Page 45, Line 72] 129. You will not be able to treat women with 
[Page 45, Line 73] equal fairness, no matter how much you de-
[Page 45, Line 74] sire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an-
[Page 45, Line 75] other suspended. If you make amends, and 
[Page 45, Line 76] act righteously —Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
[Page 45, Line 77] ciful.  
[Page 45, Line 78] 130. And if they separate, Allah will enrich each 
[Page 45, Line 79] from His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and 
[Page 45, Line 80] Wise.  
[Page 45, Line 81] 131. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
[Page 45, Line 82] ens and e verything on earth. We have in-
[Page 45, Line 83] structed those who were given the Book be-
[Page 45, Line 84] fore you, and you, to be conscious of Allah. 
[Page 45, Line 85] 34 
[Page 46, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 46, Line 2] But if you refuse —to Allah belongs every-
[Page 46, Line 3] thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
[Page 46, Line 4] Allah is in no need, Praiseworthy.  
[Page 46, Line 5] 132. To Allah belon gs everything in the heav-
[Page 46, Line 6] ens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as 
[Page 46, Line 7] Manager.  
[Page 46, Line 8] 133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O 
[Page 46, Line 9] people, and bring others. Allah is Able to do 
[Page 46, Line 10] that.  
[Page 46, Line 11] 134. Whoever desires the reward of this 
[Page 46, Line 12] world —with Allah is the reward of this  world 
[Page 46, Line 13] and the next. Allah is All -Hearing, All -See-
[Page 46, Line 14] ing. 
[Page 46, Line 15] 135. O you who believe! Stand firmly for jus-
[Page 46, Line 16] tice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against 
[Page 46, Line 17] yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives. 
[Page 46, Line 18] Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care 
[Page 46, Line 19] of both. So do not follow your desires, lest 
[Page 46, Line 20] you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away —
[Page 46, Line 21] then Allah is Aware of what you do.  
[Page 46, Line 22] 136. O you who believe! Believe in Allah and 
[Page 46, Line 23] His messenger, and the Book He sent down 
[Page 46, Line 24] to His messenger, and the Book He sent 
[Page 46, Line 25] down before. Whoever reject s Allah, His an-
[Page 46, Line 26] gels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, has strayed far in error.  
[Page 46, Line 27] 137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then 
[Page 46, Line 28] believe, then disbelieve, then increase in dis-belief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He 
[Page 46, Line 29] guide them to a way.  
[Page 46, Line 30] 138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a 
[Page 46, Line 31] painful punishment.  
[Page 46, Line 32] 139. Those who ally themselves with the disbe-
[Page 46, Line 33] lievers instead of the believers. Do they seek glory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.  
[Page 46, Line 34] 140. He has revealed to you in the Book that 
[Page 46, Line 35] when you hear Allah’s revelations being re-
[Page 46, Line 36] jected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until 
[Page 46, Line 37] they engage in some other subject. Other-
[Page 46, Line 38] wise, you would be like them. Allah will 
[Page 46, Line 39] gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether.  
[Page 46, Line 40] 141. Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain 
[Page 46, Line 41] victory from Allah, they say, “Were we not 
[Page 46, Line 42] with you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn, they say, “Did we not side with you, and de-
[Page 46, Line 43] fend you from the believers?” Allah will judge 
[Page 46, Line 44] between you on the Day of Resurrection; and 
[Page 46, Line 45] Allah wi ll give the disbelievers no means of 
[Page 46, Line 46] overcoming the believers.  
[Page 46, Line 47] 142. The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He 
[Page 46, Line 48] is deceiving them. And when they stand for 
[Page 46, Line 49] prayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front 
[Page 46, Line 50] of people, and remembering Allah only a lit-tle. 
[Page 46, Line 51] 143. Wavering in between, neither with these, 
[Page 46, Line 52] nor with those. Whomever Allah sends 
[Page 46, Line 53] astray, you will never find for him a way.  
[Page 46, Line 54] 144. O you who believe! Do not befriend disbe-
[Page 46, Line 55] lievers rather than believers. Do you want to give Allah a clear case against you?  
[Page 46, Line 56] 145. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level 
[Page 46, Line 57] of the Fire, and you will find no helper for 
[Page 46, Line 58] them.  
[Page 46, Line 59] 146. Except those who repent, and reform, and 
[Page 46, Line 60] hold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion to Allah alone. These are with the believers; 
[Page 46, Line 61] and Allah will give the believers a great re-
[Page 46, Line 62] ward.  
[Page 46, Line 63] 147. What would Allah accomplish by your 
[Page 46, Line 64] punishment, if you have given thanks, and 
[Page 46, Line 65] have believed? Allah is Appreciative and 
[Page 46, Line 66] Cognizant.  
[Page 46, Line 67] 148. Allah does not like the public uttering of 
[Page 46, Line 68] bad language, unless someone was wronged. 
[Page 46, Line 69] Allah  is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 46, Line 70] 149. If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal 
[Page 46, Line 71] it, or pardon an offense —Allah is Pardoning 
[Page 46, Line 72] and Capable.  
[Page 46, Line 73] 150. Those who disbelieve in Allah and His 
[Page 46, Line 74] messengers, and want to separate between 
[Page 46, Line 75] Allah and His messengers, and say, “We be-lieve in some, and reject some,” and wish to 
[Page 46, Line 76] take a path in between.  
[Page 46, Line 77] 151. These are the unbelievers, truly. We have 
[Page 46, Line 78] prepared for the unbelievers a shameful pun-
[Page 46, Line 79] ishment.  
[Page 46, Line 80] 35 
[Page 47, Line 1] 4.  WOMEN   (an-Nisa’)  
[Page 47, Line 2] 152. As for those who believe in Allah and His 
[Page 47, Line 3] messengers, and make no distinction be-
[Page 47, Line 4] tween any of them —He will give them their 
[Page 47, Line 5] rewards. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.  
[Page 47, Line 6] 153. The People of the Scripture challenge you 
[Page 47, Line 7] to bring down to them a book from the sky. They had asked Moses for something even 
[Page 47, Line 8] greater. They said, “Show us Allah plainly.” 
[Page 47, Line 9] The thunderbolt struck them for their wick-
[Page 47, Line 10] edness. Then they took the calf for worship, even after the clear proofs had come to them. 
[Page 47, Line 11] Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a 
[Page 47, Line 12] clear authority.  
[Page 47, Line 13] 154. And We raised the Mount above them in 
[Page 47, Line 14] accordance with their covenant, and We said to them, “Enter the gate humbly”, and We 
[Page 47, Line 15] said to them, “Do not violate the Sabbath”, 
[Page 47, Line 16] and We received from them a solemn pledge.  
[Page 47, Line 17] 155. But for their violation of their covenant, 
[Page 47, Line 18] and their denial of Allah’s revelations, and 
[Page 47, Line 19] their killing  of the prophets unjustly, and 
[Page 47, Line 20] their saying, “Our minds are closed.” In fact, 
[Page 47, Line 21] Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so 
[Page 47, Line 22] they do not believe, except for a few.  
[Page 47, Line 23] 156. And for their faithlessness, and their say-
[Page 47, Line 24] ing against Mary a monstrous slander.  
[Page 47, Line 25] 157. And  for their saying, “We have killed the 
[Page 47, Line 26] Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen-
[Page 47, Line 27] ger of Allah.” In fact, they did not kill him, 
[Page 47, Line 28] nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to 
[Page 47, Line 29] them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ 
[Page 47, Line 30] about him are in doubt about it. The y have 
[Page 47, Line 31] no knowledge of it, except the following of as-
[Page 47, Line 32] sumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.  
[Page 47, Line 33] 158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. 
[Page 47, Line 34] Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 47, Line 35] 159. There is none from the People of the 
[Page 47, Line 36] Scripture but will believe in him before his 
[Page 47, Line 37] death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will 
[Page 47, Line 38] be a witness against them.  
[Page 47, Line 39] 160. Due to wrongdoing on the part of the 
[Page 47, Line 40] Jews, We forbade them good things that used 
[Page 47, Line 41] to be lawful for them; and for deterring many 
[Page 47, Line 42] from Allah’s path.  
[Page 47, Line 43] 161. And for their taking usury,  although they 
[Page 47, Line 44] were forbidden it; and for their consuming people's wealth dishonestly. We have pre-
[Page 47, Line 45] pared for the faithless among them a painful 
[Page 47, Line 46] torment.  
[Page 47, Line 47] 162. But those among them firmly rooted in 
[Page 47, Line 48] knowledge, and the believers, believe in what 
[Page 47, Line 49] was revealed to  you, and in what was revealed 
[Page 47, Line 50] before you; and the observers of prayers, and 
[Page 47, Line 51] the givers of charity, and the believers in Al-
[Page 47, Line 52] lah and the Last Day —upon these We will be-
[Page 47, Line 53] stow an immense reward.  
[Page 47, Line 54] 163. We have inspired you, as We had inspired 
[Page 47, Line 55] Noah and the prophets after him. And We in-spired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and 
[Page 47, Line 56] Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, 
[Page 47, Line 57] and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And 
[Page 47, Line 58] We gave David the Psalms.  
[Page 47, Line 59] 164. Some messeng ers We have already told 
[Page 47, Line 60] you about, while some messengers We have 
[Page 47, Line 61] not told you about. And Allah spoke to Mo-
[Page 47, Line 62] ses directly.  
[Page 47, Line 63] 165. Messengers delivering good news, and 
[Page 47, Line 64] bringing warnings; so that people may have 
[Page 47, Line 65] no excuse before Allah after the coming of 
[Page 47, Line 66] the mes sengers. Allah is Powerful and Wise.  
[Page 47, Line 67] 166. But Allah bears witness to what He re-
[Page 47, Line 68] vealed to you. He revealed it with His 
[Page 47, Line 69] knowledge. And the angels bear witness. 
[Page 47, Line 70] Though Allah is a sufficient witness.  
[Page 47, Line 71] 167. Those who disbelieve and repel from Al-
[Page 47, Line 72] lah’s path have g one far astray.  
[Page 47, Line 73] 168.  Those who disbelieve and transgress; Al-
[Page 47, Line 74] lah is not about to forgive them, nor will He 
[Page 47, Line 75] guide them to any path.  
[Page 47, Line 76] 169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will 
[Page 47, Line 77] dwell forever. And that is easy for Allah.  
[Page 47, Line 78] 170. O people! The Messenger has come to you 
[Page 47, Line 79] with the truth from your Lord, so believe —
[Page 47, Line 80] that is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to 
[Page 47, Line 81] Allah belongs everything in the heavens and 
[Page 47, Line 82] the earth. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.  
[Page 47, Line 83] 171. O People of the Scripture! Do not exagger-
[Page 47, Line 84] ate in your religion, a nd do not say about Al-
[Page 47, Line 85] lah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the 
[Page 47, Line 86] son of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and 
[Page 47, Line 87] His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a 
[Page 47, Line 88] 36 
[Page 48, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 48, Line 2] Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His 
[Page 48, Line 3] messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Re-
[Page 48, Line 4] frain— it is better for you. Allah is only one 
[Page 48, Line 5] God. Glory be to Him —that He should have 
[Page 48, Line 6] a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is a suffi-
[Page 48, Line 7] cient Protector.  
[Page 48, Line 8] 172. The Messiah does not disdain to be a serv-
[Page 48, Line 9] ant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. W ho-
[Page 48, Line 10] ever disdains His worship, and is too arro-
[Page 48, Line 11] gant —He will round them up to Himself al-
[Page 48, Line 12] together.  
[Page 48, Line 13] 173. But as for those who believe and do good 
[Page 48, Line 14] works, He will pay them their wages in full, and will increase His grace for them. But as for those who disdain and are too proud, He 
[Page 48, Line 15] will punish them with an agonizing punish-ment. And they will find for themselves, 
[Page 48, Line 16] apart from Allah, no lord and no savior.  
[Page 48, Line 17] 174. O people! A proof has come to you from 
[Page 48, Line 18] your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear light.  
[Page 48, Line 19] 175. As for those who  believe in Allah, and hold 
[Page 48, Line 20] fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy 
[Page 48, Line 21] and grace from Him, and will guide them to 
[Page 48, Line 22] Himself in a straight path.  
[Page 48, Line 23] 176. They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives 
[Page 48, Line 24] you a ruling concerning the person who has 
[Page 48, Line 25] neither parents nor c hildren.” If a man dies, 
[Page 48, Line 26] and leaves no children, and he had a sister, 
[Page 48, Line 27] she receives one- half of what he leaves. And 
[Page 48, Line 28] he inherits from her if she leaves no children. 
[Page 48, Line 29] But if there are two sisters, they receive two -
[Page 48, Line 30] thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are 
[Page 48, Line 31] men and women, the male receives the share 
[Page 48, Line 32] of two females.” Allah makes things clear for 
[Page 48, Line 33] you, lest you err. Allah is Aware of every-
[Page 48, Line 34] thing.  

[Page 48, Line 36] 5. THE TABLE  
[Page 48, Line 37] (al-Ma’idah ) 
[Page 48, Line 38] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 48, Line 39] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 48, Line 40] 1. O you who believe! Fulfill your commit-
[Page 48, Line 41] ments. Livestock animals are permitted for you, except those specified to you; but not 
[Page 48, Line 42] wild game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. 
[Page 48, Line 43] Allah decrees whatever He wills.  
[Page 48, Line 44] 2. O you who believe! Do not violate Allah’s 
[Page 48, Line 45] sacraments, nor the Sacred Month, nor the offerings, nor the garlanded, nor those head-
[Page 48, Line 46] ing for the Sacred House seeking blessings 
[Page 48, Line 47] from their Lord and approval. When you 
[Page 48, Line 48] have left the pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt. 
[Page 48, Line 49] And let not the hatred of people who barred 
[Page 48, Line 50] you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to ag-gression. And cooperate with one another in 
[Page 48, Line 51] virtuous conduct and conscience, and do not cooperate with one another in sin and hostil-
[Page 48, Line 52] ity. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
[Page 48, Line 53] ment.  
[Page 48, Line 54] 3. Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the 
[Page 48, Line 55] flesh of swine, and animals  dedicated to other 
[Page 48, Line 56] than Allah; also the flesh of animals stran-
[Page 48, Line 57] gled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to 
[Page 48, Line 58] death, mangled by wild animals —except 
[Page 48, Line 59] what you rescue, and animals sacrificed on 
[Page 48, Line 60] altars; and the practice of drawing lots. For it 
[Page 48, Line 61] is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have 
[Page 48, Line 62] despaired of your religion, so do not fear 
[Page 48, Line 63] them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected 
[Page 48, Line 64] your religion for you, and have completed 
[Page 48, Line 65] My favor upon you, and have approved Islam 
[Page 48, Line 66] as a religion for you. But whoever is com-
[Page 48, Line 67] pelled by hu nger, with no intent of wrongdo-
[Page 48, Line 68] ing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 48, Line 69] 4. They ask you what is permitted for them. 
[Page 48, Line 70] Say, “Permitted for you are all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you.” You train them according to 
[Page 48, Line 71] what Allah has taught you. So eat from what 
[Page 48, Line 72] they catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s 
[Page 48, Line 73] name over it. And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in 
[Page 48, Line 74] reckoning.  
[Page 48, Line 75] 5. Today all good things are made lawful for 
[Page 48, Line 76] you. And the food of those given the Scrip-
[Page 48, Line 77] ture is lawful for you, and your food i s lawful 
[Page 48, Line 78] for them. So are chaste believing women, and chaste women from the people who were 
[Page 48, Line 79] given the Scripture before you, provided you 
[Page 48, Line 80] give them their dowries, and take them in 
[Page 48, Line 81] marriage, not in adultery, nor as mistresses. But whoever rejects faith, his work will be in 
[Page 48, Line 82] 37 
[Page 49, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 49, Line 2] vain, and in the Hereafter he will be among 
[Page 49, Line 3] the losers.  
[Page 49, Line 4] 6. O you who believe! When you rise to pray, 
[Page 49, Line 5] wash your faces and your hands and arms to 
[Page 49, Line 6] the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your 
[Page 49, Line 7] feet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then 
[Page 49, Line 8] purif y yourselves. If you are ill, or travelling, 
[Page 49, Line 9] or one of you returns from the toilet, or you 
[Page 49, Line 10] had contact with women, and could not find 
[Page 49, Line 11] water, then use some clean sand and wipe 
[Page 49, Line 12] your faces and hands with it. Allah does not 
[Page 49, Line 13] intend to burden you, but He intends  to pu-
[Page 49, Line 14] rify you, and to complete His blessing upon 
[Page 49, Line 15] you, that you may be thankful.  
[Page 49, Line 16] 7. And Remember Allah’s blessings upon you, 
[Page 49, Line 17] and His covenant which He covenanted with 
[Page 49, Line 18] you; when you said, “We hear and we obey.” 
[Page 49, Line 19] And remain conscious of Allah, for Allah 
[Page 49, Line 20] knows  what the hearts contain.  
[Page 49, Line 21] 8. O you who believe! Be upright to Allah, wit-
[Page 49, Line 22] nessing with justice; and let not the hatred of 
[Page 49, Line 23] a certain people prevent you from acting justly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to 
[Page 49, Line 24] piety; and fear Allah. Allah is informed of 
[Page 49, Line 25] what you do.  
[Page 49, Line 26] 9. Allah has promised those who believe and 
[Page 49, Line 27] work righteousness: they will have for-
[Page 49, Line 28] giveness and a great reward.  
[Page 49, Line 29] 10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our 
[Page 49, Line 30] revelations —these are the inmates of Hell.  
[Page 49, Line 31] 11. O you who believe! Remember Allah's 
[Page 49, Line 32] blessings upon you; when certain people in-
[Page 49, Line 33] tended to extend their hands against you, and 
[Page 49, Line 34] He restrained their hands from you. So rev-
[Page 49, Line 35] erence Allah, and in Allah let the believers 
[Page 49, Line 36] put their trust.  
[Page 49, Line 37] 12. Allah received a pledge from the Children 
[Page 49, Line 38] of Israel, and We raised among them twelve 
[Page 49, Line 39] chiefs. Allah said, “I am with you; if you per-
[Page 49, Line 40] form the prayer, and pay the alms, and be-
[Page 49, Line 41] lieve in My messengers and support them, 
[Page 49, Line 42] and lend Allah a loan of righteousness; I will 
[Page 49, Line 43] remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens 
[Page 49, Line 44] beneath whic h rivers flow. But whoever 
[Page 49, Line 45] among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed 
[Page 49, Line 46] from the right way.”  13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We 
[Page 49, Line 47] cursed them, and made their hearts hard. 
[Page 49, Line 48] They twist the words out of their context, and 
[Page 49, Line 49] they disregarded some of wha t they were re-
[Page 49, Line 50] minded of. You will always witness deceit 
[Page 49, Line 51] from them, except for a few of them. But par-
[Page 49, Line 52] don them, and overlook. Allah loves the do-
[Page 49, Line 53] ers of good.  
[Page 49, Line 54] 14. And from those who say, “We are Chris-
[Page 49, Line 55] tians,” We received their pledge, but they ne-
[Page 49, Line 56] glected some of  what they were reminded of. 
[Page 49, Line 57] So We provoked enmity and hatred among 
[Page 49, Line 58] them until the Day of Resurrection; Allah will 
[Page 49, Line 59] then inform them of what they used to craft.  
[Page 49, Line 60] 15. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has 
[Page 49, Line 61] come to you, clarifying for you much of what 
[Page 49, Line 62] you kep t hidden of the Book, and overlook-
[Page 49, Line 63] ing much. A light from Allah has come to 
[Page 49, Line 64] you, and a clear Book.  
[Page 49, Line 65] 16. Allah guides with it whoever follows His 
[Page 49, Line 66] approval to the ways of peace, and He brings 
[Page 49, Line 67] them out of darkness into light, by His per-mission, and He guides th em in a straight 
[Page 49, Line 68] path.  
[Page 49, Line 69] 17. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the 
[Page 49, Line 70] Christ, the son of Mary.” Say, “Who can pre-
[Page 49, Line 71] vent Allah, if He willed, from annihilating the 
[Page 49, Line 72] Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and eve-
[Page 49, Line 73] ryone on earth?” To Allah belongs the sover-
[Page 49, Line 74] eignty of the heavens and the earth and what 
[Page 49, Line 75] is between them. He creates whatever He 
[Page 49, Line 76] wills, and Allah has power over everything.  
[Page 49, Line 77] 18. The Jews and the Christians say, “We are 
[Page 49, Line 78] the children of Allah, and His beloved.” Say, 
[Page 49, Line 79] “Why then does He punish you for your 
[Page 49, Line 80] sins? ” In fact, you are humans from among 
[Page 49, Line 81] those He created. He forgives whom He wills, 
[Page 49, Line 82] and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah 
[Page 49, Line 83] belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
[Page 49, Line 84] earth and what lies between them, and to Him is the return.  
[Page 49, Line 85] 19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has 
[Page 49, Line 86] come to you, making things clear to you —af-
[Page 49, Line 87] ter a cessation of messengers —so that you 
[Page 49, Line 88] cannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and 
[Page 49, Line 89] no warner.” In fact, a preacher has come to 
[Page 49, Line 90] 38 
[Page 50, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 50, Line 2] you, and a warner; and Allah is Capable of 
[Page 50, Line 3] everything.  
[Page 50, Line 4] 20. When Moses  said to his people, “O my 
[Page 50, Line 5] people, remember Allah’s blessings upon 
[Page 50, Line 6] you, when He placed prophets among you, 
[Page 50, Line 7] and made you kings, and gave you what He 
[Page 50, Line 8] never gave any other people.”  
[Page 50, Line 9] 21. “O my people, enter the Holy Land which 
[Page 50, Line 10] Allah has assigned for you, and do  not turn 
[Page 50, Line 11] back, lest you return as losers.”  
[Page 50, Line 12] 22. They said, “O Moses, there are tyrannical 
[Page 50, Line 13] people in it; we will not enter it until they 
[Page 50, Line 14] leave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.”  
[Page 50, Line 15] 23. Two men of those who feared, but whom 
[Page 50, Line 16] Allah had blessed, said, “Go  at them by the 
[Page 50, Line 17] gate; and when you have entered it, you will 
[Page 50, Line 18] prevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are 
[Page 50, Line 19] believers.”  
[Page 50, Line 20] 24. They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, 
[Page 50, Line 21] ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you 
[Page 50, Line 22] and your Lord, and fight. We are stay ing right 
[Page 50, Line 23] here.”  
[Page 50, Line 24] 25. He said, “My Lord! I have control only over 
[Page 50, Line 25] myself and my brother, so separate between 
[Page 50, Line 26] us and between the wicked people.”  
[Page 50, Line 27] 26. He said, “It is forbidden for them for forty 
[Page 50, Line 28] years. They will wander aimlessly in the land. 
[Page 50, Line 29] So do not grieve over the defiant people.”  
[Page 50, Line 30] 27. And relate to them the true story of Adam's 
[Page 50, Line 31] two sons: when they offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but it was 
[Page 50, Line 32] not accepted from the other. He Said, “I will 
[Page 50, Line 33] kill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts only from 
[Page 50, Line 34] the righteous.”  
[Page 50, Line 35] 28. “If you extend your hand to kill me, I will 
[Page 50, Line 36] not extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Al-lah, Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 50, Line 37] 29. “I would rather you bear my sin and your 
[Page 50, Line 38] sin, and you become among the inmates of 
[Page 50, Line 39] the Fire. Such is the reward for the  evildoers.”  
[Page 50, Line 40] 30. Then His soul prompted him to kill his 
[Page 50, Line 41] brother, so he killed him, and became one of 
[Page 50, Line 42] the losers.  31. Then Allah sent a raven digging the 
[Page 50, Line 43] ground, to show him how to cover his broth-
[Page 50, Line 44] er's corpse. He said, “Woe to me! I was unable 
[Page 50, Line 45] to be like thi s raven, and bury my brother's 
[Page 50, Line 46] corpse.” So he became full of regrets.  
[Page 50, Line 47] 32. Because of that We ordained for the Chil-
[Page 50, Line 48] dren of Israel: that whoever kills a person—
[Page 50, Line 49] unless it is for murder or corruption on 
[Page 50, Line 50] earth —it is as if he killed the whole of man-
[Page 50, Line 51] kind; and who ever saves it, it is as if he saved 
[Page 50, Line 52] the whole of mankind. Our messengers came 
[Page 50, Line 53] to them with clarifications, but even after 
[Page 50, Line 54] that, many of them continue to commit ex-
[Page 50, Line 55] cesses in the land.  
[Page 50, Line 56] 33. The punishment for those who fight Allah 
[Page 50, Line 57] and His Messenger, and strive  to spread cor-
[Page 50, Line 58] ruption on earth, is that they be killed, or cru-
[Page 50, Line 59] cified, or have their hands and feet cut off on 
[Page 50, Line 60] opposite sides, or be banished from the land. 
[Page 50, Line 61] That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the 
[Page 50, Line 62] Hereafter they will have a terrible punish-
[Page 50, Line 63] ment.  
[Page 50, Line 64] 34. Except for those who repent before you ap-
[Page 50, Line 65] prehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiv-ing and Merciful.  
[Page 50, Line 66] 35. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
[Page 50, Line 67] and seek the means of approach to Him, and 
[Page 50, Line 68] strive in His cause, so that you may succeed.  
[Page 50, Line 69] 36.  As for those who disbelieve, even if they 
[Page 50, Line 70] owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom them-
[Page 50, Line 71] selves from the torment of the Day of Resur-
[Page 50, Line 72] rection, it will not be accepted from them. 
[Page 50, Line 73] For them is a painful punishment.  
[Page 50, Line 74] 37. They will want to leave the Fire, but they 
[Page 50, Line 75] will not leave it. For them is a lasting punish-ment.  
[Page 50, Line 76] 38. As for the thief, whether male or female, 
[Page 50, Line 77] cut their hands as a penalty for what they 
[Page 50, Line 78] have reaped —a deterrent from Allah. Allah is 
[Page 50, Line 79] Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 50, Line 80] 39. But whoever rep ents after his crime, and 
[Page 50, Line 81] reforms, Allah will accept his repentance. Al-
[Page 50, Line 82] lah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 50, Line 83] 40. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the 
[Page 50, Line 84] kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He 
[Page 50, Line 85] 39 
[Page 51, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 51, Line 2] punishes whom He wills, and He forgives 
[Page 51, Line 3] whom He wills. And Allah is  Capable of eve-
[Page 51, Line 4] rything.  
[Page 51, Line 5] 41. O Messenger! Do not let those who are 
[Page 51, Line 6] quick to disbelief grieve you —from among 
[Page 51, Line 7] those who say with their mouths, “We be-
[Page 51, Line 8] lieve,” but their hearts do not believe; and 
[Page 51, Line 9] from among the Jews —listeners to lies, lis-
[Page 51, Line 10] teners to other people who did not come to 
[Page 51, Line 11] you. They distort words from their places, and they say, “If you are given this, accept it; but if you are not given it, beware.” Whom-
[Page 51, Line 12] ever Allah has willed to divert, you have 
[Page 51, Line 13] nothing for him from Allah. Those are they 
[Page 51, Line 14] whose hearts Alla h does not intend to purify. 
[Page 51, Line 15] For them is disgrace in this world, and for 
[Page 51, Line 16] them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.  
[Page 51, Line 17] 42. Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit 
[Page 51, Line 18] earnings. If they come to you, judge between 
[Page 51, Line 19] them, or turn away from them. If you turn 
[Page 51, Line 20] away  from them, they will not harm you in 
[Page 51, Line 21] the least. But if you judge, judge between them equitably. Allah loves the equitable.  
[Page 51, Line 22] 43. But why do they come to you for judgment, 
[Page 51, Line 23] when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s 
[Page 51, Line 24] Law? Yet they turn away after that. Thes e are 
[Page 51, Line 25] not believers.  
[Page 51, Line 26] 44. We have revealed the Torah, wherein is 
[Page 51, Line 27] guidance and light. The submissive prophets 
[Page 51, Line 28] ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rab-
[Page 51, Line 29] bis and the scholars, as they were required to 
[Page 51, Line 30] protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it. 
[Page 51, Line 31] So do n ot fear people, but fear Me. And do 
[Page 51, Line 32] not sell My revelations for a cheap price. Those who do not rule according to what Al-
[Page 51, Line 33] lah revealed are the unbelievers.  
[Page 51, Line 34] 45. And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, 
[Page 51, Line 35] an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for 
[Page 51, Line 36] an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it 
[Page 51, Line 37] in charity, it will serve as atonement for him. 
[Page 51, Line 38] Those who do not rule according to what Al-
[Page 51, Line 39] lah revealed are the evildoers.  
[Page 51, Line 40] 46. In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of 
[Page 51, Line 41] Mary,  fulfilling the Torah that preceded him; 
[Page 51, Line 42] and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the To-
[Page 51, Line 43] rah that preceded him, and guidance and 
[Page 51, Line 44] counsel for the righteous.  
[Page 51, Line 45] 47. So let the people of the Gospel rule accord-
[Page 51, Line 46] ing to what Allah rev ealed in it. Those who 
[Page 51, Line 47] do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners.  
[Page 51, Line 48] 48. And We revealed to you the Book, with 
[Page 51, Line 49] truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded 
[Page 51, Line 50] it, and superseding it. So judge between them 
[Page 51, Line 51] according to what Allah revealed, and  do not 
[Page 51, Line 52] follow their desires if they differ from the 
[Page 51, Line 53] truth that has come to you. For each of you 
[Page 51, Line 54] We have assigned a law and a method. Had 
[Page 51, Line 55] Allah willed, He could have made you a single nation, but He tests you through what He has 
[Page 51, Line 56] given you. So compete in ri ghteousness. To 
[Page 51, Line 57] Allah is your return, all of you; then He will 
[Page 51, Line 58] inform you of what you had disputed.  
[Page 51, Line 59] 49. And judge between them according to 
[Page 51, Line 60] what Allah revealed, and do not follow their 
[Page 51, Line 61] desires. And beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has re-
[Page 51, Line 62] vealed to you. But if they turn away, know that Allah intends to strike them with some 
[Page 51, Line 63] of their sins. In fact, a great many people are 
[Page 51, Line 64] corrupt.  
[Page 51, Line 65] 50. Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that 
[Page 51, Line 66] they desire? Who is better than Allah in judg-
[Page 51, Line 67] ment f or people who are certain?  
[Page 51, Line 68] 51. O you who believe! Do not take the Jews 
[Page 51, Line 69] and the Christians as allies; some of them are 
[Page 51, Line 70] allies of one another. Whoever of you allies himself with them is one of them. Allah does 
[Page 51, Line 71] not guide the wrongdoing people.  
[Page 51, Line 72] 52. You will se e those in whose hearts is sick-
[Page 51, Line 73] ness racing towards them. They say, “We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us.” But 
[Page 51, Line 74] perhaps Allah will bring about victory, or 
[Page 51, Line 75] some event of His making; thereupon they 
[Page 51, Line 76] will regret what they concealed within them-selves.  
[Page 51, Line 77] 53. Those who believe will say, “Are these the 
[Page 51, Line 78] ones who swore by Allah with their strongest 
[Page 51, Line 79] oaths that they are with you?” Their works 
[Page 51, Line 80] have failed, so they became losers.  
[Page 51, Line 81] 40 
[Page 52, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 52, Line 2] 54. O you who believe! Whoever of you goes 
[Page 52, Line 3] back on his religion— Allah will bring a peo-
[Page 52, Line 4] ple whom He loves and who love Him, kind 
[Page 52, Line 5] towards the believers, stern with the disbe-
[Page 52, Line 6] lievers. They strive in the way of Allah, and 
[Page 52, Line 7] do not fear the blame of the critic. That is the 
[Page 52, Line 8] grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever 
[Page 52, Line 9] He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.  
[Page 52, Line 10] 55. Your allies are Allah, and His Messenger, 
[Page 52, Line 11] and those who believe —those who pray reg-
[Page 52, Line 12] ularly, and give charity, and bow down.  
[Page 52, Line 13] 56. Whoever allies himself with Allah, and His 
[Page 52, Line 14] Messenger, and those who believe —surely 
[Page 52, Line 15] the Party of Allah is the victorious.  
[Page 52, Line 16] 57. O you who believe! Do not befriend those 
[Page 52, Line 17] who take your religion in mockery and as a 
[Page 52, Line 18] sport, be they from among those who were 
[Page 52, Line 19] given the Scripture before you, or the disbe-
[Page 52, Line 20] lievers. And obey Allah, if you are believers.  
[Page 52, Line 21] 58. When you call to the prayer,  they take it as 
[Page 52, Line 22] a joke and a trifle. That is because they are 
[Page 52, Line 23] people who do not reason.  
[Page 52, Line 24] 59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you re-
[Page 52, Line 25] sent us only because we believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us, and in what was 
[Page 52, Line 26] revealed previously; and most of you are sin-
[Page 52, Line 27] ners?”  
[Page 52, Line 28] 60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that 
[Page 52, Line 29] for retribution from Allah? He whom Allah 
[Page 52, Line 30] has cursed, and with whom He became an-
[Page 52, Line 31] gry; and He turned some of them into apes, 
[Page 52, Line 32] and swine, and idol worshipers. These are in 
[Page 52, Line 33] a worse position, a nd further away from the 
[Page 52, Line 34] right way.”  
[Page 52, Line 35] 61. When they come to you, they say, “We be-
[Page 52, Line 36] lieve,” though they have entered with disbe-
[Page 52, Line 37] lief, and they have departed with it. But Allah 
[Page 52, Line 38] is well aware of what they hide.  
[Page 52, Line 39] 62. You see many of them competing with one 
[Page 52, Line 40] another in sin and hostility, and their con-
[Page 52, Line 41] suming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.  
[Page 52, Line 42] 63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not pre-
[Page 52, Line 43] vent them from speaking sinfully and from 
[Page 52, Line 44] consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what 
[Page 52, Line 45] they have been doing.  64. The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” It is 
[Page 52, Line 46] their hands that are tied, and they are cursed 
[Page 52, Line 47] for what they say. In fact, His hands are out-
[Page 52, Line 48] stretched; He gives as He wills. Certainly, 
[Page 52, Line 49] what was revealed to your from your Lord 
[Page 52, Line 50] will increase many of them in defiance and 
[Page 52, Line 51] blasphemy. And We placed between them 
[Page 52, Line 52] enmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 52, Line 53] tion. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, 
[Page 52, Line 54] Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to spread corruption on earth. Allah does not 
[Page 52, Line 55] love the corrupters.  
[Page 52, Line 56] 65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed 
[Page 52, Line 57] and been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gar-
[Page 52, Line 58] dens of Bliss.  
[Page 52, Line 59] 66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gos-
[Page 52, Line 60] pel, and what was revealed to them from their 
[Page 52, Line 61] Lord, they would have consumed a mply from 
[Page 52, Line 62] above them, and from beneath their feet. 
[Page 52, Line 63] Among them is a moderate community, but 
[Page 52, Line 64] evil is what many of them are doing.  
[Page 52, Line 65] 67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to 
[Page 52, Line 66] you from your Lord. But if you do not, then 
[Page 52, Line 67] you would not have delivered His messa ge. 
[Page 52, Line 68] And Allah will protect you from the people. 
[Page 52, Line 69] Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.  
[Page 52, Line 70] 68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have 
[Page 52, Line 71] no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the 
[Page 52, Line 72] Gospel, and what is revealed to you from 
[Page 52, Line 73] your Lord.” But what is reveal ed to you from 
[Page 52, Line 74] your Lord will increase many of them in re-
[Page 52, Line 75] bellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for 
[Page 52, Line 76] the disbelieving people.  
[Page 52, Line 77] 69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the 
[Page 52, Line 78] Sabians, and the Christians —whoever be-
[Page 52, Line 79] lieves in Allah and the Last Day, and does 
[Page 52, Line 80] what is right— they have nothing to fear, nor 
[Page 52, Line 81] shall they grieve.  
[Page 52, Line 82] 70. We made a covenant with the Children of 
[Page 52, Line 83] Israel, and We sent to them messengers. 
[Page 52, Line 84] Whenever a messenger came to them with 
[Page 52, Line 85] what their souls did not desire, some of them 
[Page 52, Line 86] they accused of lying, and others they put to 
[Page 52, Line 87] death.  
[Page 52, Line 88] 41 
[Page 53, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 53, Line 2] 71. They assumed there would be no punish-
[Page 53, Line 3] ment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Al-
[Page 53, Line 4] lah redeemed them, but then again many of 
[Page 53, Line 5] them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is See-
[Page 53, Line 6] ing of what they do.  
[Page 53, Line 7] 72. They disbelieve those who say, “ Allah is the 
[Page 53, Line 8] Messiah the son of Mary.” But the Messiah 
[Page 53, Line 9] himself said, “O Children of Israel, worship 
[Page 53, Line 10] Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever as-
[Page 53, Line 11] sociates others with Allah, Allah has forbid-
[Page 53, Line 12] den him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. 
[Page 53, Line 13] The wrongdoers have no s aviors.”  
[Page 53, Line 14] 73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the 
[Page 53, Line 15] third of three.” But there is no deity except 
[Page 53, Line 16] the One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those 
[Page 53, Line 17] among them who disbelieve.  
[Page 53, Line 18] 74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His 
[Page 53, Line 19] forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 53, Line 20] 75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes-
[Page 53, Line 21] senger, before whom other Messengers had 
[Page 53, Line 22] passed away, and his mother was a woman of 
[Page 53, Line 23] truth. They both used to eat food. Note how 
[Page 53, Line 24] We make clear the revelatio ns to them; then 
[Page 53, Line 25] note how deluded they are.  
[Page 53, Line 26] 76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what 
[Page 53, Line 27] has no power to harm or benefit you?” But 
[Page 53, Line 28] Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.  
[Page 53, Line 29] 77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not ex-
[Page 53, Line 30] aggerate in your religion beyond the trut h; 
[Page 53, Line 31] and do not follow the opinions of people who 
[Page 53, Line 32] went astray before, and misled many, and 
[Page 53, Line 33] themselves strayed off the balanced way.”  
[Page 53, Line 34] 78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from 
[Page 53, Line 35] among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That is  because 
[Page 53, Line 36] they rebelled and used to transgress.  
[Page 53, Line 37] 79. They used not to prevent one another from 
[Page 53, Line 38] the wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what 
[Page 53, Line 39] they used to do.  
[Page 53, Line 40] 80. You will see many of them befriending 
[Page 53, Line 41] those who disbelieve. Terrible is what their 
[Page 53, Line 42] souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah 
[Page 53, Line 43] fell upon them, and in the torment they will 
[Page 53, Line 44] remain.  81. Had they believed in Allah and the 
[Page 53, Line 45] Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, 
[Page 53, Line 46] they would not have befriended them. But 
[Page 53, Line 47] many of them are immoral.  
[Page 53, Line 48] 82. You will find that t he people most hostile 
[Page 53, Line 49] towards the believers are the Jews and the 
[Page 53, Line 50] polytheists. And you will find that the nearest 
[Page 53, Line 51] in affection towards the believers are those 
[Page 53, Line 52] who say, “We are Christians.” That is because 
[Page 53, Line 53] among them are priests and monks, and they 
[Page 53, Line 54] are not arrogant.  
[Page 53, Line 55] 83. And when they hear what was revealed to 
[Page 53, Line 56] the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing 
[Page 53, Line 57] with tears, as they recognize the truth in it. 
[Page 53, Line 58] They say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so 
[Page 53, Line 59] count us among the witnesses.”  
[Page 53, Line 60] 84. “And why should we not believe i n Allah, 
[Page 53, Line 61] and in the truth that has come to us, and hope 
[Page 53, Line 62] that our Lord will include us among the 
[Page 53, Line 63] righteous people?”  
[Page 53, Line 64] 85. Allah will reward them for what they say —
[Page 53, Line 65] Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where 
[Page 53, Line 66] they will stay forever. Such is the reward of 
[Page 53, Line 67] the right eous.  
[Page 53, Line 68] 86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny 
[Page 53, Line 69] Our signs —these are the inmates of the Fire.  
[Page 53, Line 70] 87. O you who believe! Do not prohibit the 
[Page 53, Line 71] good things Allah has permitted for you, and 
[Page 53, Line 72] do not commit aggression. Allah does not 
[Page 53, Line 73] love the aggressors.  
[Page 53, Line 74] 88. And ea t of the lawful and good things Allah 
[Page 53, Line 75] has provided for you; and be conscious of Al-
[Page 53, Line 76] lah, in whom you are believers.  
[Page 53, Line 77] 89. Allah does not hold you accountable for 
[Page 53, Line 78] your unintended oaths, but He holds you ac-
[Page 53, Line 79] countable for your binding oaths. The atone-ment for it i s by feeding ten needy people 
[Page 53, Line 80] from the average of what you feed your fam-ilies, or by clothing them, or by freeing a 
[Page 53, Line 81] slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast 
[Page 53, Line 82] for three days. That is the atonement for 
[Page 53, Line 83] breaking your oaths when you have sworn 
[Page 53, Line 84] them. So keep  your oaths. Thus Allah makes 
[Page 53, Line 85] clear His Revelations to you, that you may be 
[Page 53, Line 86] grateful.  
[Page 53, Line 87] 42 
[Page 54, Line 1] 5.  THE TABLE   (al-Ma’idah)  
[Page 54, Line 2] 90. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, 
[Page 54, Line 3] idolatry, and divination are abominations of 
[Page 54, Line 4] Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may 
[Page 54, Line 5] prosper.  
[Page 54, Line 6] 91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred 
[Page 54, Line 7] among you through intoxicants and gam-
[Page 54, Line 8] bling, and to prevent you from the remem-
[Page 54, Line 9] brance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you 
[Page 54, Line 10] not desist?  
[Page 54, Line 11] 92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and 
[Page 54, Line 12] be cautious. If you turn away —know that the 
[Page 54, Line 13] duty of Our Messeng er is clear communica-
[Page 54, Line 14] tion.  
[Page 54, Line 15] 93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds 
[Page 54, Line 16] will not be blamed for what they may have 
[Page 54, Line 17] eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith, 
[Page 54, Line 18] then remain righteous and charitable. Allah 
[Page 54, Line 19] loves the charitable.  
[Page 54, Line 20] 94. O you who believe! Allah will test you with 
[Page 54, Line 21] something of the game your hands and spears 
[Page 54, Line 22] obtain, that Allah may know who fears Him 
[Page 54, Line 23] at heart. Whoever commits aggression after 
[Page 54, Line 24] that will have a painful punishment.  
[Page 54, Line 25] 95. O you who believe! do not kill game while 
[Page 54, Line 26] you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you 
[Page 54, Line 27] kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a domestic animal comparable to what he 
[Page 54, Line 28] killed, as determined by two honest persons 
[Page 54, Line 29] among you —an offering delivered to the 
[Page 54, Line 30] Kaabah. Or he may atone  by feeding the 
[Page 54, Line 31] needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the consequences of his conduct. 
[Page 54, Line 32] Allah forgives what is past. But whoever re-
[Page 54, Line 33] peats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is 
[Page 54, Line 34] Almighty, Avenger.  
[Page 54, Line 35] 96. Permitted for you is the catch of s ea, and 
[Page 54, Line 36] its food —as sustenance for you and for trav-
[Page 54, Line 37] elers. But forbidden for you is the game of 
[Page 54, Line 38] land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And 
[Page 54, Line 39] fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.  
[Page 54, Line 40] 97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred 
[Page 54, Line 41] House, a sanctuary for the p eople, and the Sa-
[Page 54, Line 42] cred Month, and the offerings, and the gar-
[Page 54, Line 43] landed. That you may know that Allah knows 
[Page 54, Line 44] everything in the heavens and the earth, and 
[Page 54, Line 45] that Allah is Cognizant of all things.  98. Know that Allah is severe in retribution, 
[Page 54, Line 46] and that Allah is Forgiv ing and Merciful.  
[Page 54, Line 47] 99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al-
[Page 54, Line 48] lah knows what you reveal and what you con-ceal.  
[Page 54, Line 49] 100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal, 
[Page 54, Line 50] even though the abundance of the bad may 
[Page 54, Line 51] impress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you 
[Page 54, Line 52] who possess  intelligence, that you may suc-
[Page 54, Line 53] ceed.”  
[Page 54, Line 54] 101. O you who believe! Do not ask about 
[Page 54, Line 55] things that would trouble you if disclosed to you. But if you were to ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will become 
[Page 54, Line 56] obvious to you. Allah forgives that. All ah is 
[Page 54, Line 57] Forgiving and Clement.  
[Page 54, Line 58] 102. A people before you asked about them, but 
[Page 54, Line 59] then came to reject them.  
[Page 54, Line 60] 103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of 
[Page 54, Line 61] Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but 
[Page 54, Line 62] those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al-
[Page 54, Line 63] lah—most of them do not understand.  
[Page 54, Line 64] 104. And when it is said to them, “Come to 
[Page 54, Line 65] what Allah has revealed, and to the Messen-
[Page 54, Line 66] ger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers upon.” Even if their 
[Page 54, Line 67] forefathers knew nothing, and were not 
[Page 54, Line 68] guided?  
[Page 54, Line 69] 105. O you who b elieve! You are responsible 
[Page 54, Line 70] for your own souls. He who has strayed can-
[Page 54, Line 71] not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is 
[Page 54, Line 72] you return, all of you, and He will inform you 
[Page 54, Line 73] of what you used to do.  
[Page 54, Line 74] 106. O you who believe! When death ap-
[Page 54, Line 75] proaches one of you, let two reliable persons 
[Page 54, Line 76] from among you act as witnesses to the mak-ing of a bequest, or two persons from another 
[Page 54, Line 77] people if you are travelling in the land and the 
[Page 54, Line 78] event of death approaches you. Engage them 
[Page 54, Line 79] after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them 
[Page 54, Line 80] swear by All ah: “We will not sell our testi-
[Page 54, Line 81] mony for any price, even if he was a near rel-
[Page 54, Line 82] ative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testi-mony, for then we would be sinners.”  
[Page 54, Line 83] 107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of 
[Page 54, Line 84] perjury: let two others take their place, two 
[Page 54, Line 85] 43 
[Page 55, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 55, Line 2] from  among those responsible for the claim, 
[Page 55, Line 3] and have them swear by Allah, “Our testi-
[Page 55, Line 4] mony is more truthful than their testimony, 
[Page 55, Line 5] and we will not be biased, for then we would 
[Page 55, Line 6] be wrongdoers.”  
[Page 55, Line 7] 108. That makes it more likely that they will 
[Page 55, Line 8] give true testimony, fear ing that their oaths 
[Page 55, Line 9] might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. 
[Page 55, Line 10] So fear Allah, and listen. Allah does not guide the disobedient people.  
[Page 55, Line 11] 109. On the Day when Allah will gather the 
[Page 55, Line 12] messengers, then say, “What response were 
[Page 55, Line 13] you given?” They will say, “We have no 
[Page 55, Line 14] knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of 
[Page 55, Line 15] the unseen.”  
[Page 55, Line 16] 110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
[Page 55, Line 17] recall My favor upon you and upon your 
[Page 55, Line 18] mother, how I supported you with the Holy 
[Page 55, Line 19] Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib, 
[Page 55, Line 20] and in maturity. How  I taught you the Scrip-
[Page 55, Line 21] ture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos-pel. And recall that you molded from clay the 
[Page 55, Line 22] shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you 
[Page 55, Line 23] breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My 
[Page 55, Line 24] leave. And you healed the blind and the lep-rous, by My l eave; and you revived the dead, 
[Page 55, Line 25] by My leave. And recall that I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you 
[Page 55, Line 26] brought them the clear miracles. But those 
[Page 55, Line 27] who disbelieved among them said, `This is 
[Page 55, Line 28] nothing but obvious sorcery.'“  
[Page 55, Line 29] 111. “And when I inspired  the disciples: `Be-
[Page 55, Line 30] lieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said, 
[Page 55, Line 31] `We have believed, so bear witness that We 
[Page 55, Line 32] have submitted.'“  
[Page 55, Line 33] 112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son 
[Page 55, Line 34] of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for 
[Page 55, Line 35] us a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah, 
[Page 55, Line 36] if you are believers.'“  
[Page 55, Line 37] 113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that 
[Page 55, Line 38] our hearts may be reassured, and know that 
[Page 55, Line 39] you have told us the truth, and be among 
[Page 55, Line 40] those who witness it.”  
[Page 55, Line 41] 114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord, 
[Page 55, Line 42] send down for us a table from heaven, to be a 
[Page 55, Line 43] festival for us, for the first of us, and the last of us, and a sign from You; and provide for 
[Page 55, Line 44] us; You are the Best of providers.”  
[Page 55, Line 45] 115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But 
[Page 55, Line 46] whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I 
[Page 55, Line 47] will punish him with a punishment the like of 
[Page 55, Line 48] which I never punish any other being.”  
[Page 55, Line 49] 116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, 
[Page 55, Line 50] did you say to the people, `Take me and my 
[Page 55, Line 51] mother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will say, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say 
[Page 55, Line 52] what I have no right to. Had I said it, You 
[Page 55, Line 53] would have known it. You know what is in 
[Page 55, Line 54] my soul, and I do not know what is in your 
[Page 55, Line 55] soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.  
[Page 55, Line 56] 117. I only told them what You commanded 
[Page 55, Line 57] me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lor d 
[Page 55, Line 58] and your Lord. And I was a witness over them 
[Page 55, Line 59] while I was among them; but when You took 
[Page 55, Line 60] me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over 
[Page 55, Line 61] them —You are Witness over everything.  
[Page 55, Line 62] 118. If You punish them, they are Your serv-
[Page 55, Line 63] ants; but if You forgive them, You are the  
[Page 55, Line 64] Mighty and Wise.”  
[Page 55, Line 65] 119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the 
[Page 55, Line 66] truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” 
[Page 55, Line 67] They will have Gardens beneath which rivers 
[Page 55, Line 68] flow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah 
[Page 55, Line 69] is pleased with them, and they are pleased 
[Page 55, Line 70] with Him. T hat is the great attainment.  
[Page 55, Line 71] 120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the 
[Page 55, Line 72] heavens and the earth and what lies in them, 
[Page 55, Line 73] and He has power over everything.

[Page 55, Line 76] (al-An’am ) 
[Page 55, Line 77] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 55, Line 78] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 55, Line 79] 1. Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens 
[Page 55, Line 80] and the earth, and made the darkness and the 
[Page 55, Line 81] light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals 
[Page 55, Line 82] to their Lord.  
[Page 55, Line 83] 2. It is He who created you from clay, then de-
[Page 55, Line 84] cided a term —a term determined by him. Yet 
[Page 55, Line 85] you doubt.  
[Page 55, Line 86] 44 
[Page 56, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 56, Line 2] 3. He is Allah in the heavens  and the earth. He 
[Page 56, Line 3] knows what you keep secret and what you 
[Page 56, Line 4] make public; and He knows what you earn.  
[Page 56, Line 5] 4. Not one of their Lord’s signs comes to them, 
[Page 56, Line 6] but they turn away from it.  
[Page 56, Line 7] 5. They denied the truth when it has come to 
[Page 56, Line 8] them; but soon will reach them the news of 
[Page 56, Line 9] what they used to ridicule.  
[Page 56, Line 10] 6. Have they not considered how many gener-
[Page 56, Line 11] ations We destroyed before them? We had established them on earth more firmly than 
[Page 56, Line 12] We established you, and We sent the clouds 
[Page 56, Line 13] pouring down abundant rain on them, and 
[Page 56, Line 14] We made rive rs flow beneath them. But We 
[Page 56, Line 15] destroyed them for their sins, and established 
[Page 56, Line 16] other civilizations after them.  
[Page 56, Line 17] 7. Had We sent down upon you a book on pa-
[Page 56, Line 18] per, and they had touched it with their hands, 
[Page 56, Line 19] those who disbelieve would have said, “This 
[Page 56, Line 20] is nothing but p lain magic.”  
[Page 56, Line 21] 8. And they say, “Why was an angel not sent 
[Page 56, Line 22] down to him.” Had We sent down an angel, 
[Page 56, Line 23] the matter would have been settled, and they 
[Page 56, Line 24] would not have been reprieved.  
[Page 56, Line 25] 9. Had We made him an angel, We would 
[Page 56, Line 26] have made him a man, and confused them 
[Page 56, Line 27] when they are already confused.  
[Page 56, Line 28] 10. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but 
[Page 56, Line 29] those who mocked them became besieged by 
[Page 56, Line 30] what they ridiculed.  
[Page 56, Line 31] 11. Say, “Travel the earth and observe the final 
[Page 56, Line 32] fate of the deniers.”  
[Page 56, Line 33] 12. Say, “To whom belongs what is in the heav-
[Page 56, Line 34] ens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has 
[Page 56, Line 35] inscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather 
[Page 56, Line 36] you to the Day of Resurrection, in which 
[Page 56, Line 37] there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls 
[Page 56, Line 38] do not believe.  
[Page 56, Line 39] 13. To Him belongs whatever rests in the night 
[Page 56, Line 40] and the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.  
[Page 56, Line 41] 14. Say, “Shall I take for myself a protector 
[Page 56, Line 42] other than Allah, Originator of the heavens 
[Page 56, Line 43] and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed?” 
[Page 56, Line 44] Say, “I am instructed to be the first of those who submit.” And do not be among the idol-
[Page 56, Line 45] aters.  
[Page 56, Line 46] 15. Say, “I fear, should I defy my Lord, the pun-
[Page 56, Line 47] ishment of a tremendous Day.”  
[Page 56, Line 48] 16. Whoever is spared on that Day —He had 
[Page 56, Line 49] mercy on him. That is the clear victory.  
[Page 56, Line 50] 17. If Allah touches you with adversity, none 
[Page 56, Line 51] can remove it except He. And if He touches 
[Page 56, Line 52] you with good —He is Capable of everything.  
[Page 56, Line 53] 18. He is the Supreme over His servants. He is 
[Page 56, Line 54] the Wise, the Expert.  
[Page 56, Line 55] 19. Say, “What thing is more solemn in testi-
[Page 56, Line 56] mony?” Say, “Allah is Witness between you 
[Page 56, Line 57] and me. This Quran was revealed to me, that 
[Page 56, Line 58] I may warn you with it,  and whomever it may 
[Page 56, Line 59] reach. Do you indeed testify that there are 
[Page 56, Line 60] other gods with Allah?” Say, “I myself do not 
[Page 56, Line 61] testify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am 
[Page 56, Line 62] innocent of your idolatry.”  
[Page 56, Line 63] 20. Those to whom We have given the Book 
[Page 56, Line 64] recognize it as they recognize t heir own chil-
[Page 56, Line 65] dren; but those who have lost their souls do not believe.  
[Page 56, Line 66] 21. Who does greater wrong than someone 
[Page 56, Line 67] who fabricates lies against Allah, or denies 
[Page 56, Line 68] His revelations? The wrongdoers will not 
[Page 56, Line 69] succeed.  
[Page 56, Line 70] 22. On the Day when We gather them all to-
[Page 56, Line 71] gether, t hen say to the idolaters, “Where are 
[Page 56, Line 72] your idols, those you used to claim?”  
[Page 56, Line 73] 23. Then their only argument will be to say, 
[Page 56, Line 74] “By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”  
[Page 56, Line 75] 24. Look how they lied to themselves. And 
[Page 56, Line 76] what they invented deserted them.  
[Page 56, Line 77] 25. Among them are those who listen to you; 
[Page 56, Line 78] but We place covers over their hearts, to pre-
[Page 56, Line 79] vent them from understanding it, and heavi-
[Page 56, Line 80] ness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, 
[Page 56, Line 81] they will not believe in it. Until, when they 
[Page 56, Line 82] come to you, to argue with you, those who 
[Page 56, Line 83] disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but 
[Page 56, Line 84] myths of the ancients.”  
[Page 56, Line 85] 26. They keep others from it, and avoid it 
[Page 56, Line 86] themselves; but they ruin only their own 
[Page 56, Line 87] souls, and they do not realize.  
[Page 56, Line 88] 45 
[Page 57, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 57, Line 2] 27. If only you could see, when they are made 
[Page 57, Line 3] to stand before the Fire; the y will say, “If only 
[Page 57, Line 4] we could be sent back, and not reject the rev-
[Page 57, Line 5] elations of our Lord, and be among the faith-
[Page 57, Line 6] ful.”  
[Page 57, Line 7] 28. What they used to conceal before will be-
[Page 57, Line 8] come clear to them. And even if they were 
[Page 57, Line 9] sent back, they would revert to what they 
[Page 57, Line 10] were forbidd en. They are liars.  
[Page 57, Line 11] 29. And they say, “There is nothing but our life 
[Page 57, Line 12] in this world, and we will not be resurrected.”  
[Page 57, Line 13] 30. If only you could see, when they are sta-
[Page 57, Line 14] tioned before their Lord. He will say, “Is this 
[Page 57, Line 15] not real?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our 
[Page 57, Line 16] Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the torment 
[Page 57, Line 17] for having disbelieved.”  
[Page 57, Line 18] 31. Losers are those who deny the encounter 
[Page 57, Line 19] with Allah. Then, when the Hour comes 
[Page 57, Line 20] upon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas for 
[Page 57, Line 21] us, how we have neglected it.” And they will 
[Page 57, Line 22] carry their burd ens on their backs —evil is 
[Page 57, Line 23] what they carry.  
[Page 57, Line 24] 32. The life of this world is nothing but game 
[Page 57, Line 25] and distraction, but the Home of the Hereaf-ter is better for those who are righteous. Do 
[Page 57, Line 26] you not understand?  
[Page 57, Line 27] 33. We know that what they say grieves you. It 
[Page 57, Line 28] is not you they reject, but it is Allah's revela-
[Page 57, Line 29] tions that the wicked deny.  
[Page 57, Line 30] 34. Other messengers before you were re-
[Page 57, Line 31] jected, but they endured rejection and perse-
[Page 57, Line 32] cution until Our help came to them. There can be no change to Allah’s words. News of 
[Page 57, Line 33] the Messengers has al ready reached you.  
[Page 57, Line 34] 35. If you find their rejection hard to bear, then 
[Page 57, Line 35] if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a stairway into the heaven, and bring them a 
[Page 57, Line 36] sign. Had Allah willed, He could have gath-
[Page 57, Line 37] ered them to guidance. So do not be of the ig-
[Page 57, Line 38] norant.  
[Page 57, Line 39] 36. Only those who listen will respond. As for 
[Page 57, Line 40] the dead, Allah will resurrect them; then to 
[Page 57, Line 41] Him they will be returned.  
[Page 57, Line 42] 37. And they say, “If only a sign could come 
[Page 57, Line 43] down to him from his Lord.” Say, “Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them 
[Page 57, Line 44] do not know.”  
[Page 57, Line 45] 38. There is no animal on land, nor a bird fly-
[Page 57, Line 46] ing with its wings, but are communities like 
[Page 57, Line 47] you. We neglected nothing in the Scripture. 
[Page 57, Line 48] Then to their Lord they will be gathered.  
[Page 57, Line 49] 39. Those who reject Our revelations are deaf 
[Page 57, Line 50] and dumb, in total darknes s. Whomever Al-
[Page 57, Line 51] lah wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He wills, He sets on a straight path.  
[Page 57, Line 52] 40. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun-
[Page 57, Line 53] ishment came upon you, or the Hour over-
[Page 57, Line 54] took you, would you call upon any other than 
[Page 57, Line 55] Allah, if you are sincere?”  
[Page 57, Line 56] 41. In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if 
[Page 57, Line 57] He wills, he will remove what you called Him for, and you will forget what you idolized.  
[Page 57, Line 58] 42. We sent messengers to communities be-
[Page 57, Line 59] fore you, and We afflicted them with suffer-
[Page 57, Line 60] ing and hardship, that they may humble 
[Page 57, Line 61] themselves.  
[Page 57, Line 62] 43. If only, when Our calamity came upon 
[Page 57, Line 63] them, they humbled themselves. But their 
[Page 57, Line 64] hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds 
[Page 57, Line 65] appear good to them.  
[Page 57, Line 66] 44. Then, when they disregarded what they 
[Page 57, Line 67] were reminded of, We opened for them the 
[Page 57, Line 68] gates of all t hings. Until, when they delighted 
[Page 57, Line 69] in what they were given, We seized them sud-
[Page 57, Line 70] denly; and at once, they were in despair.  
[Page 57, Line 71] 45. Thus the last remnant of the people who 
[Page 57, Line 72] did wrong was cut off. And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 57, Line 73] 46. Say, “Have you conside red? If Allah took 
[Page 57, Line 74] away your hearing and your sight, and set a 
[Page 57, Line 75] seal on your hearts, what god other than Al-
[Page 57, Line 76] lah would restore them to you?” Note how 
[Page 57, Line 77] We explain the revelations in various ways, 
[Page 57, Line 78] yet they still turn away.  
[Page 57, Line 79] 47. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah 's pun-
[Page 57, Line 80] ishment descended on you suddenly or grad-
[Page 57, Line 81] ually, would any be destroyed except the 
[Page 57, Line 82] wrongdoing people?”  
[Page 57, Line 83] 48. We sent the messengers only as bearers of 
[Page 57, Line 84] good news and as warners. Those who believe 
[Page 57, Line 85] 46 
[Page 58, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOC K  (al-An’am)  
[Page 58, Line 2] and reform have nothing to fear, nor shall 
[Page 58, Line 3] they grieve.  
[Page 58, Line 4] 49. But as for those who reject Our revelations, 
[Page 58, Line 5] torment will afflict them because of their de-
[Page 58, Line 6] fiance.  
[Page 58, Line 7] 50. Say, “I do not say to you that I possess the 
[Page 58, Line 8] treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future, 
[Page 58, Line 9] nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only 
[Page 58, Line 10] follow what i s inspired to me.” Say, “Are the 
[Page 58, Line 11] blind and the seeing alike? Do you not think?”  
[Page 58, Line 12] 51. And warn with it those who fear to be gath-
[Page 58, Line 13] ered before their Lord —they have no protec-
[Page 58, Line 14] tor or intercessor apart from him —perhaps 
[Page 58, Line 15] they will grow in piety.  
[Page 58, Line 16] 52. And do not drive away those who call upon 
[Page 58, Line 17] their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His 
[Page 58, Line 18] attention. You are not accountable for them 
[Page 58, Line 19] in any way, nor are they accountable for you 
[Page 58, Line 20] in any way. If you drive them away, you 
[Page 58, Line 21] would be one of the unjust.  
[Page 58, Line 22] 53. Thus We try some of them by means of 
[Page 58, Line 23] others, that they may say, “Are these the ones 
[Page 58, Line 24] whom Allah has favored from among us?” Is 
[Page 58, Line 25] Allah not aware of the appreciative?  
[Page 58, Line 26] 54. When those who believe in Our revelations 
[Page 58, Line 27] come to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your 
[Page 58, Line 28] Lord has prescribed mercy for  Himself. 
[Page 58, Line 29] Whoever among you does wrong out of igno-
[Page 58, Line 30] rance, and then repents afterwards and re-
[Page 58, Line 31] forms —He is Forgiving and Merciful.”  
[Page 58, Line 32] 55. Thus We explain the revelations, and ex-
[Page 58, Line 33] pose the path of the unrighteous.  
[Page 58, Line 34] 56. Say, “I am forbidden from worshiping 
[Page 58, Line 35] those you pray to besides Allah.” Say, “I will 
[Page 58, Line 36] not follow your desires; else I would be lost and not be of those guided.”  
[Page 58, Line 37] 57. Say, “I stand on clear evidence from my 
[Page 58, Line 38] Lord, and you have rejected Him. I do not 
[Page 58, Line 39] possess what you seek me to hasten; the deci-sion belongs s olely to Allah. He states the 
[Page 58, Line 40] truth, and He is the Best of Judges.”  
[Page 58, Line 41] 58. Say, “If I possessed what you seek me to 
[Page 58, Line 42] hasten, the matter between you and me would have been settled. Allah is well aware 
[Page 58, Line 43] of the unjust.”  
[Page 58, Line 44] 59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; non e 
[Page 58, Line 45] knows them except He. And He knows eve-
[Page 58, Line 46] rything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls 
[Page 58, Line 47] but He knows it; and there is not a single 
[Page 58, Line 48] grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there an-
[Page 58, Line 49] ything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.  
[Page 58, Line 50] 60. It is He Who takes you by ni ght, and He 
[Page 58, Line 51] knows what you earn by day. Then He raises 
[Page 58, Line 52] you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled. 
[Page 58, Line 53] Then to Him is your return, then He will in-
[Page 58, Line 54] form you of what you used to do.  
[Page 58, Line 55] 61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and 
[Page 58, Line 56] He sends guardians over you, un til, when 
[Page 58, Line 57] death overtakes one of you, Our envoys take 
[Page 58, Line 58] him away, and they never fail.  
[Page 58, Line 59] 62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their 
[Page 58, Line 60] True Master. Unquestionably, His is the 
[Page 58, Line 61] judgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon-
[Page 58, Line 62] ers. 
[Page 58, Line 63] 63. Say, “Who delivers you from the d arkness 
[Page 58, Line 64] of land and sea?” You call upon Him humbly 
[Page 58, Line 65] and inwardly: “If He delivers us from this, 
[Page 58, Line 66] We will surely be among the thankful.”   
[Page 58, Line 67] 64. Say, “It is Allah who delivers you from it, 
[Page 58, Line 68] and from every disaster. Yet then you associ-ate others with Him.”  
[Page 58, Line 69] 65. Say, “He is Able to send upon you an afflic-
[Page 58, Line 70] tion, from above you, or from under your 
[Page 58, Line 71] feet. Or He can divide you into factions, and 
[Page 58, Line 72] make you taste the violence of one another. 
[Page 58, Line 73] Note how We explain the revelations, so that 
[Page 58, Line 74] they may understand.”  
[Page 58, Line 75] 66. But your pe ople rejected it, though it is the 
[Page 58, Line 76] truth. Say, “I am not responsible for you.”  
[Page 58, Line 77] 67. For every happening is a finality, and you 
[Page 58, Line 78] will surely know.  
[Page 58, Line 79] 68. When you encounter those who gossip 
[Page 58, Line 80] about Our revelations, turn away from them, until they engage in another  topic. But should 
[Page 58, Line 81] Satan make you forget, do not sit after the 
[Page 58, Line 82] recollection with the wicked people.  
[Page 58, Line 83] 47 
[Page 59, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 59, Line 2] 69. The righteous are in no way accountable 
[Page 59, Line 3] for them; it is only a reminder, that they may 
[Page 59, Line 4] be careful.  
[Page 59, Line 5] 70. So leave alone those who take their religion 
[Page 59, Line 6] for play and pastime, and whom the worldly 
[Page 59, Line 7] life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a 
[Page 59, Line 8] soul becomes damned on account of what it 
[Page 59, Line 9] has earned. It has no helper or intercessor be-
[Page 59, Line 10] sides Allah. Even if it offers every equivalent, 
[Page 59, Line 11] none will be accepted from it. The se are the 
[Page 59, Line 12] ones who are delivered to perdition by their 
[Page 59, Line 13] actions. They will have a drink of scalding 
[Page 59, Line 14] water, and a painful punishment, because 
[Page 59, Line 15] they used to disbelieve.  
[Page 59, Line 16] 71. Say, “Shall we invoke besides Allah some-
[Page 59, Line 17] thing that can neither benefit us nor harm us,  
[Page 59, Line 18] and turn back on our heels after Allah has 
[Page 59, Line 19] guided us; like someone seduced by the devils 
[Page 59, Line 20] and confused on earth, who has friends call-
[Page 59, Line 21] ing him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” Say, “The 
[Page 59, Line 22] guidance of Allah is the guidance, and we are 
[Page 59, Line 23] commanded to surrender to the L ord of the 
[Page 59, Line 24] Universe.”  
[Page 59, Line 25] 72. “And to perform the prayers, and to revere 
[Page 59, Line 26] Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered.”  
[Page 59, Line 27] 73. It is He who created the heavens and the 
[Page 59, Line 28] earth in truth. On the Day when He says: 
[Page 59, Line 29] “Be,” it will be. His saying is the truth, and 
[Page 59, Line 30] His is the sovereignty on the Day when the 
[Page 59, Line 31] trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and 
[Page 59, Line 32] declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.  
[Page 59, Line 33] 74. Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you 
[Page 59, Line 34] take idols for gods? I see that you and your 
[Page 59, Line 35] people are in evident error.”  
[Page 59, Line 36] 75. Thus We sh owed Abraham the empire of 
[Page 59, Line 37] the heavens and the earth, that he might be 
[Page 59, Line 38] one of those with certainty.  
[Page 59, Line 39] 76. When the night fell over him, he saw a 
[Page 59, Line 40] planet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when 
[Page 59, Line 41] it set, he said, “I do not love those that set.”  
[Page 59, Line 42] 77. Then, when he s aw the moon rising, he 
[Page 59, Line 43] said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be 
[Page 59, Line 44] one of the erring people.”  
[Page 59, Line 45] 78. Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, 
[Page 59, Line 46] “This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it set, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of 
[Page 59, Line 47] your idolatry.  
[Page 59, Line 48] 79. I have directed my attention towards Him 
[Page 59, Line 49] Who created the heavens and the earth —a 
[Page 59, Line 50] monotheist— and I am not of the idolaters.”  
[Page 59, Line 51] 80. And his people argued with him. He said, 
[Page 59, Line 52] “Do you argue with me about Allah, when He  
[Page 59, Line 53] has guided me? I do not fear what you asso-
[Page 59, Line 54] ciate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My 
[Page 59, Line 55] Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. 
[Page 59, Line 56] Will you not reconsider?  
[Page 59, Line 57] 81. And why should I fear those you associate 
[Page 59, Line 58] with Him, and you do not fear associating 
[Page 59, Line 59] others with Al lah for which He sent down to 
[Page 59, Line 60] you no authority? Which side is more enti-
[Page 59, Line 61] tled to security, if you are aware?”  
[Page 59, Line 62] 82. Those who believe, and do not obscure 
[Page 59, Line 63] their faith with wrongdoing —those will have 
[Page 59, Line 64] security, and they are guided.  
[Page 59, Line 65] 83. That was Our argument which  We gave to 
[Page 59, Line 66] Abraham against his people. We elevate by 
[Page 59, Line 67] degrees whomever We will. Your Lord is 
[Page 59, Line 68] Wise and Informed.  
[Page 59, Line 69] 84. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob —each 
[Page 59, Line 70] of them We guided. And We guided Noah 
[Page 59, Line 71] previously; and from his descendants David, 
[Page 59, Line 72] and Solomon, and Job,  and Joseph, and Mo-
[Page 59, Line 73] ses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the right-
[Page 59, Line 74] eous.  
[Page 59, Line 75] 85. And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and 
[Page 59, Line 76] Elias —every one of them was of the upright.  
[Page 59, Line 77] 86. And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and 
[Page 59, Line 78] Lot— We favored each one of them over all 
[Page 59, Line 79] other people.  
[Page 59, Line 80] 87. And of their ancestors, and their descend-
[Page 59, Line 81] ants, and their siblings —We chose them, and 
[Page 59, Line 82] guided them to a straight path.  
[Page 59, Line 83] 88. Such is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it 
[Page 59, Line 84] whomever He wills of His servants. Had they 
[Page 59, Line 85] associated, their deeds would have gone in 
[Page 59, Line 86] vain.  
[Page 59, Line 87] 89. Those are they to whom We gave the Book, 
[Page 59, Line 88] and wisdom, and prophethood. If these reject 
[Page 59, Line 89] them, We have entrusted them to others who 
[Page 59, Line 90] do not reject them.  
[Page 59, Line 91] 48 
[Page 60, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 60, Line 2] 90. Those are they whom Allah has guided, so 
[Page 60, Line 3] follow their guidance. Say, “I ask of you no 
[Page 60, Line 4] compensatio n for it; it is just a reminder for 
[Page 60, Line 5] all mankind.”  
[Page 60, Line 6] 91. They do not value Allah as He should be 
[Page 60, Line 7] valued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal anything to any human being.” Say, “Who re-
[Page 60, Line 8] vealed the Scripture which Moses brought—
[Page 60, Line 9] a light and guidance for humanity? ” You put 
[Page 60, Line 10] it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing 
[Page 60, Line 11] much. And you were taught what you did not 
[Page 60, Line 12] know —neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, 
[Page 60, Line 13] “Allah;” then leave them toying away in their 
[Page 60, Line 14] speculation.  
[Page 60, Line 15] 92. This too is a Scripture that We revealed —
[Page 60, Line 16] blessed —verifying what preceded it, that you 
[Page 60, Line 17] may warn the Mother of Cities and all around 
[Page 60, Line 18] it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe 
[Page 60, Line 19] in it, and are dedicated to their prayers.  
[Page 60, Line 20] 93. Who does greater wrong than someone 
[Page 60, Line 21] who invents falsehood against Allah, or says,  
[Page 60, Line 22] “It was revealed to me,” when nothing was re-
[Page 60, Line 23] vealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of 
[Page 60, Line 24] what Allah revealed”? If only you could see 
[Page 60, Line 25] the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the 
[Page 60, Line 26] angels with arms outstretched: “Give up your 
[Page 60, Line 27] souls. Today you are bein g repaid with the 
[Page 60, Line 28] torment of shame for having said about Allah 
[Page 60, Line 29] other than the truth, and for being too proud 
[Page 60, Line 30] to accept His revelations.”  
[Page 60, Line 31] 94. “You have come to Us individually, just as 
[Page 60, Line 32] We created you the first time, leaving behind 
[Page 60, Line 33] you everything We gave you . We do not see 
[Page 60, Line 34] with you your intercessors —those you 
[Page 60, Line 35] claimed were your partners. The link be-
[Page 60, Line 36] tween you is cut, and what you had asserted has failed you.”  
[Page 60, Line 37] 95. It is Allah Who splits the grain and the 
[Page 60, Line 38] seed. He brings the living from the dead, and 
[Page 60, Line 39] He brings th e dead from the living. Such is 
[Page 60, Line 40] Allah. So how could you deviate?  
[Page 60, Line 41] 96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He 
[Page 60, Line 42] made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for calculation. Such is the disposition 
[Page 60, Line 43] of the Almighty, the All -Knowing.  97. And it is He Who created the stars for you, 
[Page 60, Line 44] that you may be guided by them in the dark-
[Page 60, Line 45] ness of land and sea. We thus explain the rev-
[Page 60, Line 46] elations for people who know.  
[Page 60, Line 47] 98. And it is He who produced you from a sin-
[Page 60, Line 48] gle person, then a repository, then a deposi-
[Page 60, Line 49] tory. We have detailed the r evelations for 
[Page 60, Line 50] people who understand.  
[Page 60, Line 51] 99. And it is He who sends down water from 
[Page 60, Line 52] the sky. With it We produce vegetation of all 
[Page 60, Line 53] kinds, from which We bring greenery, from 
[Page 60, Line 54] which We produce grains in clusters. And 
[Page 60, Line 55] palm -trees with hanging clusters, and vine-
[Page 60, Line 56] yard s, and olives, and pomegranates —similar 
[Page 60, Line 57] and dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they 
[Page 60, Line 58] grow and ripen. Surely in this are signs for 
[Page 60, Line 59] people who believe.  
[Page 60, Line 60] 100. Yet they attributed to Allah partners —the 
[Page 60, Line 61] sprites— although He created them. And they 
[Page 60, Line 62] invented for Him sons and daughters, with-
[Page 60, Line 63] out any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is 
[Page 60, Line 64] exalted, beyond what they describe.  
[Page 60, Line 65] 101. Originator of the heavens and the earth—
[Page 60, Line 66] how can He have a son when He never had a 
[Page 60, Line 67] companion? He created all things, and He 
[Page 60, Line 68] has knowledge of all thing s.  
[Page 60, Line 69] 102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god 
[Page 60, Line 70] except He, the Creator of all things; so wor-
[Page 60, Line 71] ship Him. He is responsible for everything.  
[Page 60, Line 72] 103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is 
[Page 60, Line 73] over all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert.  
[Page 60, Line 74] 104. “Insights have com e to you from your 
[Page 60, Line 75] Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his 
[Page 60, Line 76] soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its 
[Page 60, Line 77] detriment. I am not a guardian over you.”  
[Page 60, Line 78] 105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they 
[Page 60, Line 79] say, “You have studied,” and to clarify them 
[Page 60, Line 80] for pe ople who know.  
[Page 60, Line 81] 106. Follow what was revealed to you from 
[Page 60, Line 82] your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn 
[Page 60, Line 83] away from the polytheists.  
[Page 60, Line 84] 107. Had Allah willed, they would not have 
[Page 60, Line 85] practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you as 
[Page 60, Line 86] a guardian over them, and you are not a  man-
[Page 60, Line 87] ager over them.  
[Page 60, Line 88] 49 
[Page 61, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 61, Line 2] 108. Do not insult those they call upon besides 
[Page 61, Line 3] Allah, lest they insult Allah out of hostility 
[Page 61, Line 4] and ignorance. We made attractive to every 
[Page 61, Line 5] community their deeds. Then to their Lord is 
[Page 61, Line 6] their return, and He will inform them of what 
[Page 61, Line 7] they us ed to do.  
[Page 61, Line 8] 109. They swear by Allah, with their most sol-
[Page 61, Line 9] emn oaths, that if a miracle were to come to 
[Page 61, Line 10] them, they would believe in it. Say, “The mir-
[Page 61, Line 11] acles are only with Allah.” But how do you 
[Page 61, Line 12] know? Even if it did come, they still would 
[Page 61, Line 13] not believe.  
[Page 61, Line 14] 110. And We  turn away their hearts and their 
[Page 61, Line 15] visions, as they refused to believe in it the first 
[Page 61, Line 16] time, and We leave them blundering in their 
[Page 61, Line 17] rebellion.  
[Page 61, Line 18] 111. Even if We sent down the angels to them, 
[Page 61, Line 19] and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered 
[Page 61, Line 20] all things before them, they still would not 
[Page 61, Line 21] believe, unless Allah wills; but most of them 
[Page 61, Line 22] are ignorant.  
[Page 61, Line 23] 112. Likewise, We have assigned for every 
[Page 61, Line 24] prophet an enemy —human and jinn devils —
[Page 61, Line 25] inspiring one another with fancy words in or-
[Page 61, Line 26] der to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they 
[Page 61, Line 27] wou ld not have done it. So leave them to their 
[Page 61, Line 28] fabrications.  
[Page 61, Line 29] 113. So that the hearts of those who do not be-
[Page 61, Line 30] lieve in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be 
[Page 61, Line 31] content with it, and that they may perpetrate 
[Page 61, Line 32] whatever they perpetrate.  
[Page 61, Line 33] 114. “Shall I seek a judge othe r than Allah, 
[Page 61, Line 34] when He is the One who revealed to you the 
[Page 61, Line 35] Book, explained in detail?” Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is the truth re-
[Page 61, Line 36] vealed from your Lord. So do not be of those 
[Page 61, Line 37] who doubt.  
[Page 61, Line 38] 115. The Word of your Lord has been com-
[Page 61, Line 39] pleted, in truth and justice. There is no 
[Page 61, Line 40] changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the 
[Page 61, Line 41] Knower.  
[Page 61, Line 42] 116. If you were to obey most of those on earth, 
[Page 61, Line 43] they would divert you from Allah’s path. 
[Page 61, Line 44] They follow nothing but assumptions, and 
[Page 61, Line 45] they only conjecture.  117. Your Lord knows best who strays from His 
[Page 61, Line 46] path, and He knows best the guided ones.  
[Page 61, Line 47] 118. So eat of that over which the Name of Al-
[Page 61, Line 48] lah was pronounced, if you indeed believe in His revelations.  
[Page 61, Line 49] 119. And why should you not eat of that over 
[Page 61, Line 50] which the Name of Allah is pronounced, 
[Page 61, Line 51] when He has detailed for you what is prohib-
[Page 61, Line 52] ited for you, unless you are compelled by ne-
[Page 61, Line 53] cessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, 
[Page 61, Line 54] through lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows 
[Page 61, Line 55] best the transgressors.  
[Page 61, Line 56] 120. So abandon sin, outward and inward. 
[Page 61, Line 57] Those who commit sins will be repaid for 
[Page 61, Line 58] what they used to perpetrate.  
[Page 61, Line 59] 121. And do not eat from that over which the 
[Page 61, Line 60] Name of Allah was not pronounced, for it is 
[Page 61, Line 61] abomination. The devils inspire their follow-
[Page 61, Line 62] ers to argue with you; but if you obey them, 
[Page 61, Line 63] you would be polytheists . 
[Page 61, Line 64] 122. Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, 
[Page 61, Line 65] and made for him a light by which he walks 
[Page 61, Line 66] among the people, like he who is in total 
[Page 61, Line 67] darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the 
[Page 61, Line 68] doings of disbelievers are made to appear 
[Page 61, Line 69] good to them.  
[Page 61, Line 70] 123. And thus We set  up in every city its lead-
[Page 61, Line 71] ing wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they conspire only against themselves, and they do 
[Page 61, Line 72] not realize it.  
[Page 61, Line 73] 124. When a sign comes to them, they say, “We 
[Page 61, Line 74] will not believe unless we are given the like of what was given to Allah’s  messengers.” Allah 
[Page 61, Line 75] knows best where to place His message. Hu-miliation from Allah and severe torment will 
[Page 61, Line 76] afflict the criminals for their scheming.  
[Page 61, Line 77] 125. Whomever Allah desires to guide, He 
[Page 61, Line 78] spreads open his heart to Islam; and whom-
[Page 61, Line 79] ever He desires to misguid e, He makes his 
[Page 61, Line 80] heart narrow, constricted, as though he were 
[Page 61, Line 81] climbing up the sky. Allah thus lays defile-
[Page 61, Line 82] ment upon those who do not believe.  
[Page 61, Line 83] 126. This is the straight path of your Lord. We 
[Page 61, Line 84] have explained the revelations in detail for 
[Page 61, Line 85] people who recollect.  
[Page 61, Line 86] 50 
[Page 62, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 62, Line 2] 127. For them is the Home of Peace with their 
[Page 62, Line 3] Lord, and He is their Master —because of 
[Page 62, Line 4] what they used to do.  
[Page 62, Line 5] 128. On the Day when He gathers them all to-
[Page 62, Line 6] gether: “O assembly of jinn, you have ex-
[Page 62, Line 7] ploited multitudes of humans.” Their adher-
[Page 62, Line 8] ents among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we 
[Page 62, Line 9] have profited from one another, but we have 
[Page 62, Line 10] reached the term that you have assigned for 
[Page 62, Line 11] us.” He will say, “The Fire is your dwelling, 
[Page 62, Line 12] wherein you will remain, except as Allah 
[Page 62, Line 13] wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.  
[Page 62, Line 14] 129. Thus We make some of the wrongdoers 
[Page 62, Line 15] befriend one another, because of what they used to do.  
[Page 62, Line 16] 130. “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there 
[Page 62, Line 17] not come to you messengers from among 
[Page 62, Line 18] you, relating to you My revelations, and 
[Page 62, Line 19] warning you of the meeting of this Day of 
[Page 62, Line 20] yours?” They wi ll say, “We testify against 
[Page 62, Line 21] ourselves.” The life of the world seduced them. They will testify against themselves 
[Page 62, Line 22] that they were disbelievers.  
[Page 62, Line 23] 131. That is because your Lord would not de-
[Page 62, Line 24] stroy towns for injustice while their inhabit-ants are unaware.  
[Page 62, Line 25] 132. They all have ranks according to what they 
[Page 62, Line 26] did; and your Lord is not unaware of what 
[Page 62, Line 27] they do.  
[Page 62, Line 28] 133. Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the 
[Page 62, Line 29] Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you, and substitute whomever He 
[Page 62, Line 30] wills in your place, just as He prod uced you 
[Page 62, Line 31] from the descendants of another people.  
[Page 62, Line 32] 134. What you are promised is coming, and 
[Page 62, Line 33] you cannot thwart it.  
[Page 62, Line 34] 135. Say, “O my people! Work according to 
[Page 62, Line 35] your ability, and so will I.” You will come to 
[Page 62, Line 36] know to whom will belong the sequel of the 
[Page 62, Line 37] abode.” The wrongdoers will not prevail.  
[Page 62, Line 38] 136. And they set aside for Allah a share of the 
[Page 62, Line 39] crops and the livestock He created, and they 
[Page 62, Line 40] say, “This is for Allah,” according to their claim, “and this is for our idols.” But the share 
[Page 62, Line 41] of their idols does not reach Allah, yet the share of Allah reaches their idols. Evil is their 
[Page 62, Line 42] judgment.  
[Page 62, Line 43] 137. Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters 
[Page 62, Line 44] to kill their children, in order to lead them to 
[Page 62, Line 45] their ruin, and confuse them in their religion. 
[Page 62, Line 46] Had Allah willed, they would not have done  
[Page 62, Line 47] it; so leave them to their fraud.  
[Page 62, Line 48] 138. And they say, “These animals and crops 
[Page 62, Line 49] are restricted; none may eat them except 
[Page 62, Line 50] those we permit,” by their claims, and ani-
[Page 62, Line 51] mals whose backs are forbidden, and animals 
[Page 62, Line 52] over which they do not pronounce the name 
[Page 62, Line 53] of Allah— fabricating lies against Him. He 
[Page 62, Line 54] will repay them for what they used to invent.  
[Page 62, Line 55] 139. And they say, “What lies in the wombs of 
[Page 62, Line 56] these animals is exclusively for our males, and prohibited to our wives.” But if it is still-
[Page 62, Line 57] born, they can share in it. He will su rely pun-
[Page 62, Line 58] ish them for their allegations. He is Wise and 
[Page 62, Line 59] Knowing.  
[Page 62, Line 60] 140. Lost are those who kill their children fool-
[Page 62, Line 61] ishly, with no basis in knowledge, and forbid 
[Page 62, Line 62] what Allah has provided for them —innova-
[Page 62, Line 63] tions about Allah. They have gone astray. 
[Page 62, Line 64] They are not guid ed. 
[Page 62, Line 65] 141. It is He who produces gardens, both culti-
[Page 62, Line 66] vated and wild, and date -palms, and crops of 
[Page 62, Line 67] diverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates, 
[Page 62, Line 68] similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it 
[Page 62, Line 69] yields, and give its due on the day of its har-
[Page 62, Line 70] vest, and do not wast e. He does not love the 
[Page 62, Line 71] wasteful.  
[Page 62, Line 72] 142. Among the livestock are some for trans-
[Page 62, Line 73] portation, and some for clothing. Eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow 
[Page 62, Line 74] the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an out-
[Page 62, Line 75] right enemy.  
[Page 62, Line 76] 143. Eight pairs: two of the sheep, and two of 
[Page 62, Line 77] the goats. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, 
[Page 62, Line 78] or the two females, or what the wombs of the 
[Page 62, Line 79] two females contain? Inform me with 
[Page 62, Line 80] knowledge, if you are truthful.” 
[Page 62, Line 81] 144. And two of the camels, and two of the cat-
[Page 62, Line 82] tle. Say, “Did He forbid the two m ales, or the 
[Page 62, Line 83] two females, or what the wombs of the two 
[Page 62, Line 84] 51 
[Page 63, Line 1] 6.  LIVESTOCK   (al-An’am)  
[Page 63, Line 2] females contain? Were you present when Al-
[Page 63, Line 3] lah enjoined this upon you?” Who does 
[Page 63, Line 4] greater wrong than he who invents lies and 
[Page 63, Line 5] attributes them to Allah, in order to mislead 
[Page 63, Line 6] people without knowledge? Allah d oes not 
[Page 63, Line 7] guide the wicked people.  
[Page 63, Line 8] 145. Say, “In what was revealed to me, I find 
[Page 63, Line 9] nothing forbidden to a consumer who eats it, except carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh 
[Page 63, Line 10] of swine —because it is impure— or a sinful 
[Page 63, Line 11] offering dedicated to other than Allah. But if 
[Page 63, Line 12] someone is compelled by necessity, without 
[Page 63, Line 13] being deliberate or malicious —your Lord is 
[Page 63, Line 14] Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 63, Line 15] 146. For the Jews We forbade everything with 
[Page 63, Line 16] claws. As of cattle and sheep: We forbade them their fat, except what adheres to their 
[Page 63, Line 17] backs, or the entrails, or what is mixed with 
[Page 63, Line 18] bone. This is how We penalized them for 
[Page 63, Line 19] their inequity. We are indeed truthful.  
[Page 63, Line 20] 147. If they accuse you of lying, say, “Your Lord 
[Page 63, Line 21] is Possessor of infinite mercy, but His wrath 
[Page 63, Line 22] cannot be averted from the guilty people.”  
[Page 63, Line 23] 148. The polytheists will say, “Had Allah willed, 
[Page 63, Line 24] we would not have practiced idolatry, nor 
[Page 63, Line 25] would have our forefathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.” Likewise those 
[Page 63, Line 26] before them lied, until they tasted Our might. 
[Page 63, Line 27] Say, “Do you have any knowledge tha t you 
[Page 63, Line 28] can produce for us? You follow nothing but 
[Page 63, Line 29] conjecture, and you only guess.”  
[Page 63, Line 30] 149. Say, “To Allah belongs the conclusive ar-
[Page 63, Line 31] gument. Had He willed, He would have 
[Page 63, Line 32] guided you all.”  
[Page 63, Line 33] 150. Say, “Produce your witnesses who would 
[Page 63, Line 34] testify that Allah has prohibited this.” If they 
[Page 63, Line 35] testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the whims of those who deny Our rev-
[Page 63, Line 36] elation, and those who do not believe in the 
[Page 63, Line 37] Hereafter, and those who equate others with 
[Page 63, Line 38] their Lord.  
[Page 63, Line 39] 151. Say, “Come, let me tell you what your Lord 
[Page 63, Line 40] has forbidden you: that you associate nothing 
[Page 63, Line 41] with Him; that you honor your parents; that 
[Page 63, Line 42] you do not kill your children because of pov-
[Page 63, Line 43] erty—We provide for you and for them; that 
[Page 63, Line 44] you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not  kill 
[Page 63, Line 45] the soul which Allah has sanctified —except 
[Page 63, Line 46] in the course of justice. All this He has en-
[Page 63, Line 47] joined upon you, so that you may under-
[Page 63, Line 48] stand.”  
[Page 63, Line 49] 152. And do not come near the property of the 
[Page 63, Line 50] orphan, except with the best intentions, until 
[Page 63, Line 51] he reaches maturity. And  give full weight and 
[Page 63, Line 52] full measure, equitably. We do not burden 
[Page 63, Line 53] any soul beyond its capacity. And when you 
[Page 63, Line 54] speak, be fair, even if it concerns a close rela-tive. And fulfill your covenant with Allah. All 
[Page 63, Line 55] this He has enjoined upon you, so that you 
[Page 63, Line 56] may take h eed. 
[Page 63, Line 57] 153. This is My path, straight, so follow it. And 
[Page 63, Line 58] do not follow the other paths, lest they divert 
[Page 63, Line 59] you from His path. All this He has enjoined 
[Page 63, Line 60] upon you, that you may refrain from wrong-
[Page 63, Line 61] doing.  
[Page 63, Line 62] 154. Then We gave Moses the Scripture, per-
[Page 63, Line 63] fect for the righte ous, and explaining every-
[Page 63, Line 64] thing clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that 
[Page 63, Line 65] they may believe in the encounter with their 
[Page 63, Line 66] Lord.  
[Page 63, Line 67] 155. This too is a blessed Scripture that We re-
[Page 63, Line 68] vealed; so follow it, and be righteous, that you 
[Page 63, Line 69] may receive mercy.  
[Page 63, Line 70] 156. Lest you say, “The Scripture was revealed 
[Page 63, Line 71] to two parties before us, and we were una-
[Page 63, Line 72] ware of their teachings.”  
[Page 63, Line 73] 157. Or lest you say, “Had the Scripture been 
[Page 63, Line 74] revealed to us, we would have been better 
[Page 63, Line 75] guided than they.” Clarification has come to 
[Page 63, Line 76] you from your Lord, and guid ance, and 
[Page 63, Line 77] mercy. Who then does greater wrong than he 
[Page 63, Line 78] who gives the lie to Allah's messages, and 
[Page 63, Line 79] turns away from them? We will repay those 
[Page 63, Line 80] who turn away from Our messages with the 
[Page 63, Line 81] worst kind of punishment, because of their 
[Page 63, Line 82] turning away.  
[Page 63, Line 83] 158. Are they waiting for anything but for the 
[Page 63, Line 84] angels to come to them, or for your Lord to 
[Page 63, Line 85] arrive, or for some of your Lord’s signs to 
[Page 63, Line 86] come? On the Day when some of your Lord’s 
[Page 63, Line 87] signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith 
[Page 63, Line 88] unless it had believed previously, o r had 
[Page 63, Line 89] 52 
[Page 64, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 64, Line 2] earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, 
[Page 64, Line 3] we too are waiting.”  
[Page 64, Line 4] 159. As for those who divided their religion 
[Page 64, Line 5] and became sects —you have nothing to do 
[Page 64, Line 6] with them. Their case rests with Allah; then 
[Page 64, Line 7] He will inform them of what they used to do.  
[Page 64, Line 8] 160. Whoever comes up with a good deed will 
[Page 64, Line 9] have ten times its like; and whoever comes up 
[Page 64, Line 10] with an evil deed will be repaid only with its 
[Page 64, Line 11] equivalent —they will not be wronged.  
[Page 64, Line 12] 161. Say, “My Lord has guided me to a straight 
[Page 64, Line 13] path, an upright religion, the creed of Ab ra-
[Page 64, Line 14] ham the Monotheist, who was not a polythe-ist.” 
[Page 64, Line 15] 162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my 
[Page 64, Line 16] life and my death, are devoted to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 64, Line 17] 163. No associate has He. Thus I am com-
[Page 64, Line 18] manded, and I am the first of those who sub-
[Page 64, Line 19] mit. 
[Page 64, Line 20] 164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Allah, 
[Page 64, Line 21] when He is the Lord of all things?” No soul gets except what it is due, and no soul bears 
[Page 64, Line 22] the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is 
[Page 64, Line 23] your return, then He will inform you regard-
[Page 64, Line 24] ing your disputes.  
[Page 64, Line 25] 165. It is He who ma de you successors on the 
[Page 64, Line 26] earth, and raised some of you in ranks over 
[Page 64, Line 27] others, in order to test you through what He has given you. Your Lord is Quick in retribu-tion, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.  

[Page 64, Line 29] 7. THE ELEVATIONS  
[Page 64, Line 30] (al-A’raf ) 
[Page 64, Line 31] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 64, Line 32] the G racious, the Merciful  
[Page 64, Line 33] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Saad.  
[Page 64, Line 34] 2. A Scripture was revealed to you, so let there 
[Page 64, Line 35] be no anxiety in your heart because of it. You are to warn with it —and a reminder for the 
[Page 64, Line 36] believers.  
[Page 64, Line 37] 3. Follow what is revealed to you from your 
[Page 64, Line 38] Lord, and do n ot follow other masters beside 
[Page 64, Line 39] Him. Little you recollect.  4. How many a town have We destroyed? Our 
[Page 64, Line 40] might came upon them by night, or while they were napping.  
[Page 64, Line 41] 5. When Our might came upon them, their 
[Page 64, Line 42] only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”  
[Page 64, Line 43] 6. We will que stion those to whom messen-
[Page 64, Line 44] gers were sent, and We will question the mes-
[Page 64, Line 45] sengers.  
[Page 64, Line 46] 7. We will narrate to them with knowledge, 
[Page 64, Line 47] for We were never absent.  
[Page 64, Line 48] 8. The scales on that Day will be just. Those 
[Page 64, Line 49] whose weights are heavy —it is they who are 
[Page 64, Line 50] the successful.  
[Page 64, Line 51] 9. But as for those whose weights are light— it 
[Page 64, Line 52] is they who have lost their souls, because they 
[Page 64, Line 53] used to mistreat Our revelations.  
[Page 64, Line 54] 10. We have established you firmly on earth, 
[Page 64, Line 55] and made for you in it livelihood —but rarely 
[Page 64, Line 56] do you give thanks.  
[Page 64, Line 57] 11. We created you, then We shaped you, then 
[Page 64, Line 58] We said to the angels, “Bow down before 
[Page 64, Line 59] Adam;” so they bowed down, except for Sa-tan; he was not of those who bowed down.  
[Page 64, Line 60] 12. He said, “What prevented you from bow-
[Page 64, Line 61] ing down when I have commanded you?” He 
[Page 64, Line 62] said, “I am better than he; Y ou created me 
[Page 64, Line 63] from fire, and You created him from mud.”  
[Page 64, Line 64] 13. He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you 
[Page 64, Line 65] to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of 
[Page 64, Line 66] the lowly!”  
[Page 64, Line 67] 14. He said, “Give me respite, until the Day 
[Page 64, Line 68] they are resurrected.”  
[Page 64, Line 69] 15. He said, “You are  of those given respite.”  
[Page 64, Line 70] 16. He said, “Because you have lured me, I will 
[Page 64, Line 71] waylay them on Your straight path.  
[Page 64, Line 72] 17. Then I will come at them from before 
[Page 64, Line 73] them, and from behind them, and from their 
[Page 64, Line 74] right, and from their left; and you will not 
[Page 64, Line 75] find most of them appreciative.”  
[Page 64, Line 76] 18. He said, “Get out of it, despised and van-
[Page 64, Line 77] quished. Whoever among them follows you—I will fill up Hell with you all.  
[Page 64, Line 78] 19. And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you 
[Page 64, Line 79] and your wife, and eat whatever you wish; but 
[Page 64, Line 80] 53 
[Page 65, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 65, Line 2] do not approach this tree, lest y ou become 
[Page 65, Line 3] sinners.”  
[Page 65, Line 4] 20. But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to 
[Page 65, Line 5] them their nakedness, which was invisible to 
[Page 65, Line 6] them. He said, “Your Lord has only forbid-
[Page 65, Line 7] den you this tree, lest you become angels, or become immortals.”  
[Page 65, Line 8] 21. And he swore to them, “I am a sincere ad-
[Page 65, Line 9] visor to you.”  
[Page 65, Line 10] 22. So he lured them with deceit. And when 
[Page 65, Line 11] they tasted the tree, their nakedness became 
[Page 65, Line 12] evident to them, and they began covering 
[Page 65, Line 13] themselves with the leaves of the Garden. 
[Page 65, Line 14] And their Lord called out to them, “Did I not 
[Page 65, Line 15] forbid you fro m this tree, and say to you that 
[Page 65, Line 16] Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”  
[Page 65, Line 17] 23. They said, “Our Lord, we have done wrong 
[Page 65, Line 18] to ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have 
[Page 65, Line 19] mercy on us, we will be among the losers.”  
[Page 65, Line 20] 24. He said, “Fall, some of you enemies to one 
[Page 65, Line 21] another. On earth you will have residence 
[Page 65, Line 22] and livelihood for a while.”  
[Page 65, Line 23] 25. He said, “In it you will live, and in it you 
[Page 65, Line 24] will die, and from it you will be brought out.”  
[Page 65, Line 25] 26. O children of Adam! We have provided 
[Page 65, Line 26] you with clothing to cover your bodies, and for luxury. But the clothing of piety —that is 
[Page 65, Line 27] best. These are some of Allah’s revelations, so 
[Page 65, Line 28] that they may take heed.  
[Page 65, Line 29] 27. O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan se-
[Page 65, Line 30] duce you, as he drove your parents out of the 
[Page 65, Line 31] Garden, stripping them of their garments, to 
[Page 65, Line 32] show them their  nakedness. He sees you, him 
[Page 65, Line 33] and his clan, from where you cannot see 
[Page 65, Line 34] them. We have made the devils friends of 
[Page 65, Line 35] those who do not believe.  
[Page 65, Line 36] 28. And when they commit an indecency, they 
[Page 65, Line 37] say, “We found our parents doing this, and 
[Page 65, Line 38] Allah has commanded us to do it.”  Say, “Al-
[Page 65, Line 39] lah does not command indecencies. Are you 
[Page 65, Line 40] attributing to Allah what you do not know?”  
[Page 65, Line 41] 29. Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to 
[Page 65, Line 42] stand devoted at every place of worship. So 
[Page 65, Line 43] call upon Him, and dedicate your faith to Him alone. Just as He originated  you, so you 
[Page 65, Line 44] will return.”  
[Page 65, Line 45] 30.  Some He has guided, and some have de-
[Page 65, Line 46] served misguidance. They have adopted the 
[Page 65, Line 47] devils for patrons rather than Allah, and they 
[Page 65, Line 48] assume that they are guided.  
[Page 65, Line 49] 31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at 
[Page 65, Line 50] every place of worship, and eat and drink, but 
[Page 65, Line 51] do not be excessive. He does not love the ex-
[Page 65, Line 52] cessive.  
[Page 65, Line 53] 32. Say, “Who forbade Allah’s finery which He 
[Page 65, Line 54] has produced for His servants, and the de-
[Page 65, Line 55] lights of livelihood?” Say, “They are for those who believe, in this present world, but exclu-
[Page 65, Line 56] sively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” We 
[Page 65, Line 57] thus detail the revelations for people who 
[Page 65, Line 58] know.  
[Page 65, Line 59] 33. Say, “My Lord has forbidden immorali-
[Page 65, Line 60] ties—both open and secret —and sin, and un-
[Page 65, Line 61] justified aggression, and that you associate 
[Page 65, Line 62] with Allah anything for which He reveal ed no 
[Page 65, Line 63] sanction, and that you say about Allah what 
[Page 65, Line 64] you do not know.”  
[Page 65, Line 65] 34. For every nation is an appointed time. 
[Page 65, Line 66] When their time has come, they cannot delay 
[Page 65, Line 67] it by one hour, nor can they advance it.  
[Page 65, Line 68] 35. O Children of Adam! When messengers 
[Page 65, Line 69] from among you come to you, relating to you 
[Page 65, Line 70] My revelations —whoever practices piety and 
[Page 65, Line 71] reforms —upon them shall be no fear, nor 
[Page 65, Line 72] shall they grieve.  
[Page 65, Line 73] 36. But as for those who reject Our revelations, 
[Page 65, Line 74] and are too proud to accept them —these are 
[Page 65, Line 75] the inmates of the Fire, where they will re-
[Page 65, Line 76] main forever.  
[Page 65, Line 77] 37. Who does greater wrong than he who in-
[Page 65, Line 78] vents lies about Allah, or denies His revela-
[Page 65, Line 79] tions? These —their share of the decree will 
[Page 65, Line 80] reach them. Until, when Our envoys come to 
[Page 65, Line 81] them, to take their souls away, they will say, 
[Page 65, Line 82] “Where are they wh om you used to pray to 
[Page 65, Line 83] besides Allah?” They will say, “They have 
[Page 65, Line 84] abandoned us,” and they will testify against themselves that they were faithless.  
[Page 65, Line 85] 38. He will say, “Join the crowds of jinn and 
[Page 65, Line 86] humans who have gone into the Fire before 
[Page 65, Line 87] 54 
[Page 66, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 66, Line 2] you.” Every time a cr owd enters, it will curse 
[Page 66, Line 3] its sister -crowd. Until, when they are all in it, 
[Page 66, Line 4] the last of them will say to the first of them, 
[Page 66, Line 5] “Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, 
[Page 66, Line 6] so inflict on them a double punishment in the 
[Page 66, Line 7] Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a dou ble, 
[Page 66, Line 8] but you do not know.”  
[Page 66, Line 9] 39. The first of them will say to the last of them, 
[Page 66, Line 10] “You have no advantage over us, so taste the 
[Page 66, Line 11] torment for what you used to earn.”  
[Page 66, Line 12] 40. Those who reject Our revelations and are 
[Page 66, Line 13] too arrogant to uphold them —the doors of 
[Page 66, Line 14] Heaven wil l not be opened for them, nor will 
[Page 66, Line 15] they enter Paradise, until the camel passes 
[Page 66, Line 16] through the eye of the needle. Thus We repay 
[Page 66, Line 17] the guilty.  
[Page 66, Line 18] 41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them 
[Page 66, Line 19] are sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong-
[Page 66, Line 20] doers.  
[Page 66, Line 21] 42. As for those who b elieve and do righteous 
[Page 66, Line 22] works —We never burden any soul beyond its 
[Page 66, Line 23] capacity —these are the inhabitants of the 
[Page 66, Line 24] Garden; abiding therein eternally.  
[Page 66, Line 25] 43. We will remove whatever rancor is in their 
[Page 66, Line 26] hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. And 
[Page 66, Line 27] they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has 
[Page 66, Line 28] guided us to this. Had Allah not guided us, 
[Page 66, Line 29] we would never be guided. The messengers of 
[Page 66, Line 30] our Lord did come with the truth.” And it will 
[Page 66, Line 31] be proclaimed to them, “This is the Garden 
[Page 66, Line 32] you are made to inherit, on account of what you used to d o.” 
[Page 66, Line 33] 44. And the inhabitants of the Garden will call 
[Page 66, Line 34] out to the inmates of the Fire, “We found 
[Page 66, Line 35] what our Lord promised us to be true; did 
[Page 66, Line 36] you find what your Lord promised you to be 
[Page 66, Line 37] true?” They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a 
[Page 66, Line 38] caller will announce in their midst,  “The 
[Page 66, Line 39] curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.”  
[Page 66, Line 40] 45. “Those who hinder from the path of Allah, 
[Page 66, Line 41] and seek to distort it, and who deny the Here-
[Page 66, Line 42] after.”  
[Page 66, Line 43] 46. And between them is a partition, and on 
[Page 66, Line 44] the Elevations are men who recognize every-
[Page 66, Line 45] one by their features. Th ey will call to the in-
[Page 66, Line 46] habitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon you.” They have not entered it, but they are 
[Page 66, Line 47] hoping.  
[Page 66, Line 48] 47. And when their eyes are directed towards 
[Page 66, Line 49] the inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our 
[Page 66, Line 50] Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing 
[Page 66, Line 51] people.”  
[Page 66, Line 52] 48. And the dwellers of the Elevations will call 
[Page 66, Line 53] to men they recognize by their features, say-
[Page 66, Line 54] ing, “Your hoardings did not avail you, nor 
[Page 66, Line 55] did your arrogance.”  
[Page 66, Line 56] 49. “Are these the ones you swore Allah will 
[Page 66, Line 57] not touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden; 
[Page 66, Line 58] you have nothing to fear, and you will not 
[Page 66, Line 59] grieve.”  
[Page 66, Line 60] 50. The inmates of the Fire will call on the in-
[Page 66, Line 61] habitants of the Garden, “Pour some water 
[Page 66, Line 62] over us, or some of what Allah has provided for you.” They will say, “Allah has forbidden 
[Page 66, Line 63] them for the disbelievers.”  
[Page 66, Line 64] 51. Those who took their religion lightly, and 
[Page 66, Line 65] in jest, and whom the worldly life deceived. Today We will ignore them, as they ignored 
[Page 66, Line 66] the meeting on this Day of theirs, and they 
[Page 66, Line 67] used to deny Our revelations.  
[Page 66, Line 68] 52. We have given them a Scripture, which We 
[Page 66, Line 69] detailed  with knowledge —guidance and 
[Page 66, Line 70] mercy for people who believe.  
[Page 66, Line 71] 53. Are they waiting for anything but its fulfill-
[Page 66, Line 72] ment? The Day its fulfillment comes true, 
[Page 66, Line 73] those who disregarded it before will say, “The 
[Page 66, Line 74] messengers of our Lord did come with the 
[Page 66, Line 75] truth. Have we any  intercessors to intercede 
[Page 66, Line 76] for us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave 
[Page 66, Line 77] differently from the way we behaved before?” 
[Page 66, Line 78] They ruined their souls, and what they used 
[Page 66, Line 79] to invent has failed them.  
[Page 66, Line 80] 54. Your Lord is Allah; He who created the 
[Page 66, Line 81] heavens and the earth in six days, then estab-
[Page 66, Line 82] lished Himself on the Throne. The night 
[Page 66, Line 83] overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently; 
[Page 66, Line 84] and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are 
[Page 66, Line 85] subservient by His command. His is the cre-
[Page 66, Line 86] ation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al-
[Page 66, Line 87] lah, Lord of al l beings.  
[Page 66, Line 88] 55. Call upon your Lord humbly and privately. 
[Page 66, Line 89] He does not love the aggressors.  
[Page 66, Line 90] 55 
[Page 67, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 67, Line 2] 56. And do not corrupt on earth after its refor-
[Page 67, Line 3] mation, and pray to Him with fear and hope. 
[Page 67, Line 4] Allah’s mercy is close to the doers of good.  
[Page 67, Line 5] 57. It is He who sends the wind  ahead of His 
[Page 67, Line 6] mercy. Then, when they have gathered up 
[Page 67, Line 7] heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land, 
[Page 67, Line 8] where We make water come down, and with 
[Page 67, Line 9] it We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We 
[Page 67, Line 10] bring out the dead —perhaps you will reflect.  
[Page 67, Line 11] 58. As for the good land, it yields its produce 
[Page 67, Line 12] by the leave of its Lord. But as for the bad, it 
[Page 67, Line 13] produces nothing but hardship and misery. Thus We explain the revelations in various 
[Page 67, Line 14] ways for people who are thankful.  
[Page 67, Line 15] 59. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O 
[Page 67, Line 16] my people! Worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. I fear for you the punish-
[Page 67, Line 17] ment of a tremendous Day.”  
[Page 67, Line 18] 60. The dignitaries among his people said, 
[Page 67, Line 19] “We see that you are in obvious error.”  
[Page 67, Line 20] 61. He said, “O my people, I am not in error, 
[Page 67, Line 21] but I am a messenger from the Lord of the  
[Page 67, Line 22] Worlds.”  
[Page 67, Line 23] 62. “I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, 
[Page 67, Line 24] and I advise you, and I know from Allah what 
[Page 67, Line 25] you do not know.”  
[Page 67, Line 26] 63. “Do you wonder that a reminder has come 
[Page 67, Line 27] to you from your Lord, through a man from among you, to warn you, and to lead you to righteo usness, so that you may attain 
[Page 67, Line 28] mercy?”  
[Page 67, Line 29] 64. But they called him a liar. So We saved him 
[Page 67, Line 30] and those with him in the Ark, and We 
[Page 67, Line 31] drowned those who rejected Our revelations. 
[Page 67, Line 32] They were blind people.  
[Page 67, Line 33] 65. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O 
[Page 67, Line 34] my people! Worsh ip Allah; you have no god 
[Page 67, Line 35] other than Him. Will you not take heed?”  
[Page 67, Line 36] 66. The elite of his people who disbelieved 
[Page 67, Line 37] said, “We see foolishness in you, and we think 
[Page 67, Line 38] that you are a liar.”  
[Page 67, Line 39] 67. He said, “O my people! There is no foolish-
[Page 67, Line 40] ness in me, but I am a messeng er from the 
[Page 67, Line 41] Lord of the Worlds.  68. “I convey to you the messages of my Lord, 
[Page 67, Line 42] and I am a trustworthy adviser to you.”  
[Page 67, Line 43] 69. “Are you surprised that a reminder has 
[Page 67, Line 44] come to you from your Lord, through a man 
[Page 67, Line 45] from among you, to warn you? Remember 
[Page 67, Line 46] how He made you  successors after the people 
[Page 67, Line 47] of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature. And remember Allah’s blessings, so that you 
[Page 67, Line 48] may prosper.”  
[Page 67, Line 49] 70. They said, “Did you come to us to make us 
[Page 67, Line 50] worship Allah alone, and abandon what our 
[Page 67, Line 51] ancestors used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are truth-
[Page 67, Line 52] ful.”  
[Page 67, Line 53] 71. He said, “Condemnation and wrath have 
[Page 67, Line 54] befallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing with me over names, which you and your an-
[Page 67, Line 55] cestors invented, for which Allah sent down 
[Page 67, Line 56] no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with 
[Page 67, Line 57] you.”  
[Page 67, Line 58] 72. So We saved him and those with him, by 
[Page 67, Line 59] mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our revelations and were 
[Page 67, Line 60] not believers.  
[Page 67, Line 61] 73. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He 
[Page 67, Line 62] said, “O my people! Worship Allah; you have  
[Page 67, Line 63] no god other than Him. Clarification has 
[Page 67, Line 64] come to you from your Lord. This she -camel 
[Page 67, Line 65] of Allah is a sign for you. So leave her to graze on Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a 
[Page 67, Line 66] painful penalty seizes you.”  
[Page 67, Line 67] 74. “And remember how He made you succes-
[Page 67, Line 68] sors af ter Aad, and settled you in the land. 
[Page 67, Line 69] You make for yourselves mansions on its 
[Page 67, Line 70] plains, and carve out dwellings in the moun-
[Page 67, Line 71] tains. So remember Allah’s benefits, and do 
[Page 67, Line 72] not roam the earth corruptingly.”  
[Page 67, Line 73] 75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant, 
[Page 67, Line 74] said to t he common people who had believed, 
[Page 67, Line 75] “Do you know that Saleh is sent from his 
[Page 67, Line 76] Lord?” They said, “We are believers in what 
[Page 67, Line 77] he was sent with.”  
[Page 67, Line 78] 76. Those who were arrogant said, “We reject 
[Page 67, Line 79] what you believe in.”  
[Page 67, Line 80] 77. So they hamstrung the she -camel, and de-
[Page 67, Line 81] fied the command of their Lord, and said, “O 
[Page 67, Line 82] 56 
[Page 68, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 68, Line 2] Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us 
[Page 68, Line 3] with, if you are one of the messengers.”  
[Page 68, Line 4] 78. Whereupon the quake overtook them, and 
[Page 68, Line 5] they became lifeless bodies in their homes.  
[Page 68, Line 6] 79. Then he turned away from them, and said, 
[Page 68, Line 7] “O my people, I have delivered to you the 
[Page 68, Line 8] message of my Lord, and I have advised you, 
[Page 68, Line 9] but you do not like those who give advice.”  
[Page 68, Line 10] 80. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do 
[Page 68, Line 11] you commit lewdness no people anywhere 
[Page 68, Line 12] have ever committed before you?”  
[Page 68, Line 13] 81. “You lust after men rather than women. 
[Page 68, Line 14] You are an excessive people.”  
[Page 68, Line 15] 82. And his people's only answer was to say, 
[Page 68, Line 16] “Expel them from your town; they are purist people.”  
[Page 68, Line 17] 83. But We saved him and his family, except 
[Page 68, Line 18] for his wife; she was of those who lagged be-hind.  
[Page 68, Line 19] 84. And We rained down on them a rain; note 
[Page 68, Line 20] the consequences for the sinners.  
[Page 68, Line 21] 85. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
[Page 68, Line 22] said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have 
[Page 68, Line 23] no god other than Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord. Give full meas-
[Page 68, Line 24] ure and  weight, and do not cheat people out 
[Page 68, Line 25] of their rights, and do not corrupt the land 
[Page 68, Line 26] once it has been set right. This is better for 
[Page 68, Line 27] you, if you are believers.”  
[Page 68, Line 28] 86. “And do not lurk on every path, making 
[Page 68, Line 29] threats and turning away from the path of Al-lah those wh o believe in Him, seeking to dis-
[Page 68, Line 30] tort it. And remember how you were few, and how He made you numerous. So note the 
[Page 68, Line 31] consequences for the corrupters.”  
[Page 68, Line 32] 87. “Since some of you believed in what I was 
[Page 68, Line 33] sent with, and some did not believe, be pa-
[Page 68, Line 34] tient until Allah ju dges between us; for He is 
[Page 68, Line 35] the Best of Judges.”  
[Page 68, Line 36] 88. The arrogant elite among his people said, 
[Page 68, Line 37] “O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town, along with those who believe with you, unless you return to our religion.” He said, “Even if 
[Page 68, Line 38] we are unwilling?”  89. “We would be fabricating falsehood 
[Page 68, Line 39] against Allah, if we were to return to your re-
[Page 68, Line 40] ligion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is 
[Page 68, Line 41] not for us to return to it, unless Allah, our 
[Page 68, Line 42] Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in 
[Page 68, Line 43] knowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our 
[Page 68, Line 44] Lord, decide between us and our people in 
[Page 68, Line 45] truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”  
[Page 68, Line 46] 90. The elite of his people who disbelieved 
[Page 68, Line 47] said, “If you follow Shuaib, you will be los-ers.”  
[Page 68, Line 48] 91. Thereupon, the quake struck them; and 
[Page 68, Line 49] they became lifeless bodies in  their homes.  
[Page 68, Line 50] 92. Those who rejected Shuaib —as if they 
[Page 68, Line 51] never prospered therein. Those who rejected Shuaib —it was they who were the losers.  
[Page 68, Line 52] 93. So he turned away from them, and said, “O 
[Page 68, Line 53] my people, I have delivered to you the mes-
[Page 68, Line 54] sages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so 
[Page 68, Line 55] why should I grieve over a disbelieving peo-
[Page 68, Line 56] ple?”  
[Page 68, Line 57] 94. We did not send any prophet to any town 
[Page 68, Line 58] but We afflicted its people with misery and 
[Page 68, Line 59] adversity, so that they may humble them-
[Page 68, Line 60] selves.  
[Page 68, Line 61] 95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of 
[Page 68, Line 62] hardship.  Until they increased in number, 
[Page 68, Line 63] and said, “Adversity and prosperity has 
[Page 68, Line 64] touched our ancestors.” Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.  
[Page 68, Line 65] 96. Had the people of the towns believed and 
[Page 68, Line 66] turned righteous, We would have opened for 
[Page 68, Line 67] them the blessin gs of the heaven and the 
[Page 68, Line 68] earth; but they rejected the truth, so We 
[Page 68, Line 69] seized them by what they were doing.  
[Page 68, Line 70] 97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that 
[Page 68, Line 71] Our might will not come upon them by night, 
[Page 68, Line 72] while they sleep?  
[Page 68, Line 73] 98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that 
[Page 68, Line 74] Our might will not come upon them by day, 
[Page 68, Line 75] while they play?  
[Page 68, Line 76] 99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None 
[Page 68, Line 77] feel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing 
[Page 68, Line 78] people.  
[Page 68, Line 79] 57 
[Page 69, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 69, Line 2] 100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the 
[Page 69, Line 3] land after its inhabitants, that if We wi lled, 
[Page 69, Line 4] We could strike them for their sins? And seal 
[Page 69, Line 5] up their hearts, so that they would not hear?  
[Page 69, Line 6] 101. These towns —We narrate to you some of 
[Page 69, Line 7] their tales. Their messengers came to them 
[Page 69, Line 8] with the clear signs, but they would not be-
[Page 69, Line 9] lieve in what they had reject ed previously. 
[Page 69, Line 10] Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.  
[Page 69, Line 11] 102. We found most of them untrue to their 
[Page 69, Line 12] covenants; We found most of them corrupt.  
[Page 69, Line 13] 103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our 
[Page 69, Line 14] miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment, 
[Page 69, Line 15] but they denounced  them. So consider the 
[Page 69, Line 16] end of the evildoers.  
[Page 69, Line 17] 104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger 
[Page 69, Line 18] from the Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 69, Line 19] 105. “It is only proper that I should not say 
[Page 69, Line 20] about Allah anything other than the truth. I 
[Page 69, Line 21] have come to you with clear evidence from 
[Page 69, Line 22] your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go 
[Page 69, Line 23] with me.”  
[Page 69, Line 24] 106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then 
[Page 69, Line 25] present it, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 69, Line 26] 107. So he threw his staff, and it was an appar-
[Page 69, Line 27] ent serpent.  
[Page 69, Line 28] 108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was 
[Page 69, Line 29] white to the onloo kers.  
[Page 69, Line 30] 109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people 
[Page 69, Line 31] said, “This is really a skilled magician.”  
[Page 69, Line 32] 110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so 
[Page 69, Line 33] what do you recommend?”  
[Page 69, Line 34] 111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother, 
[Page 69, Line 35] and send heralds to the cities.”  
[Page 69, Line 36] 112. “And let t hem bring you every skillful ma-
[Page 69, Line 37] gician.”  
[Page 69, Line 38] 113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said, 
[Page 69, Line 39] “Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the victors.”  
[Page 69, Line 40] 114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my 
[Page 69, Line 41] favorites.”  
[Page 69, Line 42] 115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or 
[Page 69, Line 43] we are t he ones to throw.”  116. He said, “You throw!” And when they 
[Page 69, Line 44] threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people, 
[Page 69, Line 45] and intimidated them, and produced a 
[Page 69, Line 46] mighty magic.  
[Page 69, Line 47] 117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your 
[Page 69, Line 48] staff.” And at once, it swallowed what they 
[Page 69, Line 49] were faking.  
[Page 69, Line 50] 118. So the truth came to pass, and what they 
[Page 69, Line 51] were producing came to nothing.  
[Page 69, Line 52] 119. There they were defeated, and utterly re-
[Page 69, Line 53] duced.  
[Page 69, Line 54] 120. And the magicians fell to their knees.  
[Page 69, Line 55] 121. They said, “We have believed in the Lord 
[Page 69, Line 56] of the Worlds.”  
[Page 69, Line 57] 122. “The Lord of Mo ses and Aaron.”  
[Page 69, Line 58] 123. Pharaoh said, “Did you believe in Him be-
[Page 69, Line 59] fore I have given you permission? This is 
[Page 69, Line 60] surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city, 
[Page 69, Line 61] in order to expel its people from it. You will 
[Page 69, Line 62] surely know.”  
[Page 69, Line 63] 124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet o n 
[Page 69, Line 64] opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”  
[Page 69, Line 65] 125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will 
[Page 69, Line 66] return.”  
[Page 69, Line 67] 126. “You are taking vengeance on us only be-
[Page 69, Line 68] cause we have believed in the signs of our 
[Page 69, Line 69] Lord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord! 
[Page 69, Line 70] Pour out patience up on us, and receive our 
[Page 69, Line 71] souls in submission.”  
[Page 69, Line 72] 127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will 
[Page 69, Line 73] you let Moses and his people cause trouble in 
[Page 69, Line 74] the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He 
[Page 69, Line 75] said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their 
[Page 69, Line 76] women. We have absolute power over them.”  
[Page 69, Line 77] 128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Al-
[Page 69, Line 78] lah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al-
[Page 69, Line 79] lah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever He wills of His servants, and the future be-
[Page 69, Line 80] longs to the righteous.”  
[Page 69, Line 81] 129. They said, “We were persecuted  before 
[Page 69, Line 82] you came to us, and after you came to us.” He said, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your 
[Page 69, Line 83] enemy, and make you successors in the land; 
[Page 69, Line 84] then He will see how you behave.”  
[Page 69, Line 85] 58 
[Page 70, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 70, Line 2] 130. And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh 
[Page 70, Line 3] with barren years, and with shortage of crops, 
[Page 70, Line 4] that they may take heed.  
[Page 70, Line 5] 131. When something good came their way, 
[Page 70, Line 6] they said, “This is ours.” And when some-
[Page 70, Line 7] thing bad happened to them, they ascribed 
[Page 70, Line 8] the evil omen to Moses and those with him. 
[Page 70, Line 9] In fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of 
[Page 70, Line 10] them do not know.  
[Page 70, Line 11] 132. And they said, “No matter what sign you 
[Page 70, Line 12] bring us, to bewitch us with, we will not be-
[Page 70, Line 13] lieve in you.”  
[Page 70, Line 14] 133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and 
[Page 70, Line 15] the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and 
[Page 70, Line 16] blood —all explicit signs —but they were too 
[Page 70, Line 17] arrogant. They were a sinful people.  
[Page 70, Line 18] 134. Whenever a plague befell them, they 
[Page 70, Line 19] would say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for us, according to the covenant He made with 
[Page 70, Line 20] you. If you lift the plague from us, we will be-
[Page 70, Line 21] lieve in you, and let the Children of Israel go 
[Page 70, Line 22] with you.”  
[Page 70, Line 23] 135. But when We lifted the plague from them, 
[Page 70, Line 24] for a term they were to fulfill, they broke their 
[Page 70, Line 25] promise.  
[Page 70, Line 26] 136. So We took vengeance on them, and 
[Page 70, Line 27] drowned them in the sea —because they re-
[Page 70, Line 28] jected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.  
[Page 70, Line 29] 137. And We mad e the oppressed people in-
[Page 70, Line 30] herit the eastern and western parts of the 
[Page 70, Line 31] land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair 
[Page 70, Line 32] promise of your Lord to the Children of Israel 
[Page 70, Line 33] was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And 
[Page 70, Line 34] We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people 
[Page 70, Line 35] had built, and what they had harvested.  
[Page 70, Line 36] 138. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
[Page 70, Line 37] across the sea. And when they came upon a 
[Page 70, Line 38] people who were devoted to some statues of 
[Page 70, Line 39] theirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god, 
[Page 70, Line 40] as they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an 
[Page 70, Line 41] ignorant people.”  
[Page 70, Line 42] 139. “What these people are concerned with is 
[Page 70, Line 43] perdition, and their deeds are based on false-
[Page 70, Line 44] hoods.”  140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other 
[Page 70, Line 45] than Allah, when He has favored you over all 
[Page 70, Line 46] other people?”  
[Page 70, Line 47] 141. Remember how We saved you fr om Phar-
[Page 70, Line 48] aoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst 
[Page 70, Line 49] of sufferings —killing your sons and sparing 
[Page 70, Line 50] your women. In that was a tremendous trial 
[Page 70, Line 51] from your Lord.  
[Page 70, Line 52] 142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights, 
[Page 70, Line 53] and completed them with ten; and thus the 
[Page 70, Line 54] time appointe d by his Lord was forty nights. 
[Page 70, Line 55] And Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take 
[Page 70, Line 56] my place among my people, and be upright, 
[Page 70, Line 57] and do not follow the way of the mischief -
[Page 70, Line 58] makers.”  
[Page 70, Line 59] 143. And when Moses came to Our appoint-
[Page 70, Line 60] ment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 
[Page 70, Line 61] “My Lor d, allow me to look and see You.” He 
[Page 70, Line 62] said, “You will not see Me, but look at the 
[Page 70, Line 63] mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see 
[Page 70, Line 64] Me.” But when his Lord manifested Himself 
[Page 70, Line 65] to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and 
[Page 70, Line 66] Moses fell down unconscious. Then, when he 
[Page 70, Line 67] recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent 
[Page 70, Line 68] to you, and I am the first of the believers.”  
[Page 70, Line 69] 144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over 
[Page 70, Line 70] all people for My messages and for My 
[Page 70, Line 71] Words. So take what I have given you, and be 
[Page 70, Line 72] one of the thankful.”  
[Page 70, Line 73] 145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets 
[Page 70, Line 74] all kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex-
[Page 70, Line 75] planation of all things. “Hold fast to them, 
[Page 70, Line 76] and exhort your people to adopt the best of 
[Page 70, Line 77] them. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”  
[Page 70, Line 78] 146. I will turn away from My revelat ions those 
[Page 70, Line 79] who behave proudly on earth without justifi-
[Page 70, Line 80] cation. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it; and if they see the path of 
[Page 70, Line 81] rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and 
[Page 70, Line 82] if they see the path of error, they will adopt it 
[Page 70, Line 83] for a path. That is because they denied Our 
[Page 70, Line 84] revelations, and paid no attention to them.  
[Page 70, Line 85] 147. Those who deny Our revelations and the 
[Page 70, Line 86] meeting of the Hereafter —their deeds will 
[Page 70, Line 87] come to nothing. Will they be repaid except according to what they used to do?  
[Page 70, Line 88] 59 
[Page 71, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 71, Line 2] 148. In his  absence, the people of Moses 
[Page 71, Line 3] adopted a calf made from their ornaments —
[Page 71, Line 4] a body which lowed. Did they not see that it 
[Page 71, Line 5] could not speak to them, nor guide them in 
[Page 71, Line 6] any way? They took it for worship. They were 
[Page 71, Line 7] in the wrong.  
[Page 71, Line 8] 149. Then, when they regretted, and re alized 
[Page 71, Line 9] that they had erred, they said, “Unless our 
[Page 71, Line 10] Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives 
[Page 71, Line 11] us, we will be among the losers.”  
[Page 71, Line 12] 150. And when Moses returned to his people, 
[Page 71, Line 13] angry and disappointed, he said, “What an 
[Page 71, Line 14] awful thing you did in my absence. Did you  
[Page 71, Line 15] forsake the commandments of your Lord so 
[Page 71, Line 16] hastily?” And he threw down the tablets; and 
[Page 71, Line 17] he took hold of his brother’s head, dragging 
[Page 71, Line 18] him towards himself. He said, “Son of my 
[Page 71, Line 19] mother, the people have overpowered me, and were about to kill me; so do not allow the 
[Page 71, Line 20] enemies to gloat over me, and do not count 
[Page 71, Line 21] me among the unjust people.”  
[Page 71, Line 22] 151. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and my 
[Page 71, Line 23] brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for 
[Page 71, Line 24] you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”   
[Page 71, Line 25] 152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred 
[Page 71, Line 26] wrath from their Lord, and humiliation in 
[Page 71, Line 27] this life. We thus requite the innovators.  
[Page 71, Line 28] 153. As for those who commit sins, and then 
[Page 71, Line 29] repent afterwards and believe —your Lord, 
[Page 71, Line 30] thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 71, Line 31] 154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took 
[Page 71, Line 32] up the tablets. In their transcript is guidance 
[Page 71, Line 33] and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.  
[Page 71, Line 34] 155. And Moses chose from his people seventy 
[Page 71, Line 35] men for Our appointment. When the tremor 
[Page 71, Line 36] shook them, he said, “My Lord, had You 
[Page 71, Line 37] willed, You could have destroyed them be-
[Page 71, Line 38] fore,  and me too. Will you destroy us for what 
[Page 71, Line 39] the fools among us have done? This is but 
[Page 71, Line 40] Your test— with it You misguide whomever 
[Page 71, Line 41] You will, and guide whomever You will. You 
[Page 71, Line 42] are our Protector, so forgive us, and have 
[Page 71, Line 43] mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”  
[Page 71, Line 44] 156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this 
[Page 71, Line 45] world, and in the Hereafter. We have turned to You.” He said, “My punishment —I inflict it upon whomever I will, but My mercy en-compasses all things. I will specify it for those 
[Page 71, Line 46] who act righteously and practice regu lar 
[Page 71, Line 47] charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”  
[Page 71, Line 48] 157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Un-
[Page 71, Line 49] lettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel in their posses-
[Page 71, Line 50] sion. He directs them to righteousness, and 
[Page 71, Line 51] deters them from evil, and allows  for them all 
[Page 71, Line 52] good things, and prohibits for them wicked-ness, and unloads the burdens and the shack-
[Page 71, Line 53] les that are upon them. Those who believe in 
[Page 71, Line 54] him, and respect him, and support him, and 
[Page 71, Line 55] follow the light that came down with him —
[Page 71, Line 56] these are the successful.  
[Page 71, Line 57] 158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Al-
[Page 71, Line 58] lah to you all —He to whom belongs the king-
[Page 71, Line 59] dom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and causes death.” 
[Page 71, Line 60] So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the 
[Page 71, Line 61] Unlettered Prophet, who believes in A llah 
[Page 71, Line 62] and His words. And follow him, that you may be guided.  
[Page 71, Line 63] 159. Among the people of Moses is a commu-
[Page 71, Line 64] nity that guides by truth, and thereby does 
[Page 71, Line 65] justice.  
[Page 71, Line 66] 160. We divided them into twelve tribal com-
[Page 71, Line 67] munities. And We inspired Moses, when his 
[Page 71, Line 68] people asked him for something to drink: “Strike the rock with your staff.” Whereupon 
[Page 71, Line 69] twelve springs gushed from it. Each group 
[Page 71, Line 70] recognized its drinking -place. And We 
[Page 71, Line 71] shaded the m with clouds, and We sent down 
[Page 71, Line 72] upon them manna and quails: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They 
[Page 71, Line 73] did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong 
[Page 71, Line 74] their own selves.  
[Page 71, Line 75] 161. And it was said to them, “Settle this town, 
[Page 71, Line 76] and eat therein whatever you wis h, and speak 
[Page 71, Line 77] modestly, and enter the gate in humility —
[Page 71, Line 78] We will forgive your sins, and will promote 
[Page 71, Line 79] the righteous.”  
[Page 71, Line 80] 162. But the wicked among them substituted 
[Page 71, Line 81] other words for the words given to them; so 
[Page 71, Line 82] We sent down upon them a plague from the 
[Page 71, Line 83] sky, because o f their wrongdoing.  
[Page 71, Line 84] 60 
[Page 72, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 72, Line 2] 163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when 
[Page 72, Line 3] they violated the Sabbath. When they ob-
[Page 72, Line 4] served the Sabbath, their fish would come to 
[Page 72, Line 5] them abundantly. But when they violated the 
[Page 72, Line 6] Sabbath, their fish would not come to them. 
[Page 72, Line 7] Thus We tried them  because they disobeyed.  
[Page 72, Line 8] 164. And when a group of them said, “Why do 
[Page 72, Line 9] you counsel a people whom Allah will anni-
[Page 72, Line 10] hilate, or punish with a severe punishment?” 
[Page 72, Line 11] They said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so 
[Page 72, Line 12] that they may become righteous.”  
[Page 72, Line 13] 165. Then, when they neglected what they were 
[Page 72, Line 14] reminded of, We saved those who prohibited 
[Page 72, Line 15] evil, and We seized those who did wrong with 
[Page 72, Line 16] a terrible punishment, because of their sinful-
[Page 72, Line 17] ness.  
[Page 72, Line 18] 166. Then, when they rebelled against the com-
[Page 72, Line 19] mands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des-
[Page 72, Line 20] picable apes.”  
[Page 72, Line 21] 167. Your Lord has announced that, He would 
[Page 72, Line 22] send against them, until the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 72, Line 23] tion, those who would inflict terrible suffer-
[Page 72, Line 24] ing upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribu-
[Page 72, Line 25] tion, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 72, Line 26] 168. And We scattered them i nto communities 
[Page 72, Line 27] on earth. Some of them righteous, and some 
[Page 72, Line 28] of them short of that. And We tested them with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they may return.  
[Page 72, Line 29] 169. They were succeeded by generations who 
[Page 72, Line 30] inherited the Scripture and chose the materi-
[Page 72, Line 31] als of this  world, saying, “We will be for-
[Page 72, Line 32] given.” And should similar materials come their way, they would again seize them. Did 
[Page 72, Line 33] they not make a covenant to uphold the 
[Page 72, Line 34] Scripture, and to not say about Allah except 
[Page 72, Line 35] the truth? Did they not study its contents? But the Hom e of the Hereafter is better for 
[Page 72, Line 36] the cautious; will you not understand?  
[Page 72, Line 37] 170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and 
[Page 72, Line 38] practice prayer —We will not waste the re-
[Page 72, Line 39] ward of the reformers.  
[Page 72, Line 40] 171. And when We suspended the mountain 
[Page 72, Line 41] over them, as if it was an umbrella, and they 
[Page 72, Line 42] thought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what 
[Page 72, Line 43] it contains, so that you may be saved.”  
[Page 72, Line 44] 172. And when Your Lord summoned the de-
[Page 72, Line 45] scendants of Adam, and made them testify 
[Page 72, Line 46] about themselves. “Am I not your Lord?” 
[Page 72, Line 47] They said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot 
[Page 72, Line 48] say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un-
[Page 72, Line 49] aware of this.”  
[Page 72, Line 50] 173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced 
[Page 72, Line 51] idolatry before; and we are their descendants 
[Page 72, Line 52] who came after them; will you destroy us for 
[Page 72, Line 53] what the fals ifiers did?”  
[Page 72, Line 54] 174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that 
[Page 72, Line 55] they may return.  
[Page 72, Line 56] 175. And relate to them the story of him to 
[Page 72, Line 57] whom We delivered Our signs, but he de-
[Page 72, Line 58] tached himself from them, so Satan went af-
[Page 72, Line 59] ter him, and he became one of the perverts.  
[Page 72, Line 60] 176. Had W e willed, We could have elevated 
[Page 72, Line 61] him through them; but he clung to the 
[Page 72, Line 62] ground, and followed his desires. His meta-phor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants; 
[Page 72, Line 63] and if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the 
[Page 72, Line 64] metaphor of the people who deny Our signs. 
[Page 72, Line 65] So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.  
[Page 72, Line 66] 177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re-
[Page 72, Line 67] ject Our signs and wrong themselves.  
[Page 72, Line 68] 178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. 
[Page 72, Line 69] And whomever He sends astray —these are 
[Page 72, Line 70] the losers.  
[Page 72, Line 71] 179. We have destined for Hell mul titudes of 
[Page 72, Line 72] jinn and humans. They have hearts with 
[Page 72, Line 73] which they do not understand. They have eyes with which they do not see. They have 
[Page 72, Line 74] ears with which they do not hear. These are 
[Page 72, Line 75] like cattle. In fact, they are further astray. 
[Page 72, Line 76] These are the heedless.  
[Page 72, Line 77] 180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful 
[Page 72, Line 78] Names, so call Him by them, and disregard 
[Page 72, Line 79] those who blaspheme His names. They will 
[Page 72, Line 80] be repaid for what they used to do.  
[Page 72, Line 81] 181. Among those We created is a commu-
[Page 72, Line 82] nity—they guide by truth, and do justice 
[Page 72, Line 83] thereby.  
[Page 72, Line 84] 61 
[Page 73, Line 1] 7.  THE ELEVATIONS   (al-A’raf)  
[Page 73, Line 2] 182. As for those  who reject Our messages, We 
[Page 73, Line 3] will gradually lead them from where they do 
[Page 73, Line 4] not know.  
[Page 73, Line 5] 183. And I will encourage them. My plan is 
[Page 73, Line 6] firm.  
[Page 73, Line 7] 184. Do they not think? There is no madness in 
[Page 73, Line 8] their friend. He is but a plain warner.  
[Page 73, Line 9] 185. Have they not observed the gover nment of 
[Page 73, Line 10] the heavens and the earth, and all the things that Allah created, and that their time may have drawn near? Which message, besides 
[Page 73, Line 11] this, will they believe in?  
[Page 73, Line 12] 186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide. 
[Page 73, Line 13] And He leaves them blundering in their 
[Page 73, Line 14] transg ression.  
[Page 73, Line 15] 187. They ask you about the Hour, “When will 
[Page 73, Line 16] it come?” Say, “Knowledge of it rests with my 
[Page 73, Line 17] Lord. None can reveal its coming except He. It weighs heavily on the heavens and the 
[Page 73, Line 18] earth. It will not come upon you except sud-
[Page 73, Line 19] denly.” They ask you as if you are responsible 
[Page 73, Line 20] for it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Allah,” but most people do not know.  
[Page 73, Line 21] 188. Say, “I have no control over any benefit or 
[Page 73, Line 22] harm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I 
[Page 73, Line 23] known the future, I would have acquired 
[Page 73, Line 24] much good, and no harm would have 
[Page 73, Line 25] touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald 
[Page 73, Line 26] of good news to a people who believe.”  
[Page 73, Line 27] 189. It is He who created you from a single per-
[Page 73, Line 28] son, and made from it its mate, that he may 
[Page 73, Line 29] find comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a light load, and 
[Page 73, Line 30] she carries it around. But when she has grown heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You 
[Page 73, Line 31] give us a good child, we will be among the 
[Page 73, Line 32] thankful.”  
[Page 73, Line 33] 190. But when He has given them a good child, 
[Page 73, Line 34] they attribute partners to Him in what He has 
[Page 73, Line 35] given them. Allah is exalted above what they 
[Page 73, Line 36] associate.  
[Page 73, Line 37] 191. Do they idolize those who create nothing, 
[Page 73, Line 38] and are themselves created?  
[Page 73, Line 39] 192. And can neither help them, nor help their 
[Page 73, Line 40] own selves?  193. And if you invite them to guidance, they 
[Page 73, Line 41] will not follow you. I t is the same for you, 
[Page 73, Line 42] whether you invite them, or remain silent.  
[Page 73, Line 43] 194. Those you call upon besides Allah are 
[Page 73, Line 44] servants like you. So call upon them, and let 
[Page 73, Line 45] them answer you, if you are truthful.  
[Page 73, Line 46] 195. Do they have feet with which they walk? 
[Page 73, Line 47] Or do they have ha nds with which they 
[Page 73, Line 48] strike? Or do they have eyes with which they 
[Page 73, Line 49] see? Or do they have ears with which they 
[Page 73, Line 50] hear? Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot 
[Page 73, Line 51] against me, and do not wait.”  
[Page 73, Line 52] 196. “My Master is Allah, He Who sent down 
[Page 73, Line 53] the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”  
[Page 73, Line 54] 197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot 
[Page 73, Line 55] help you, nor can they help themselves.  
[Page 73, Line 56] 198. And if you call them to guidance, they will 
[Page 73, Line 57] not hear. And you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.  
[Page 73, Line 58] 199. Be tolerant, and command decency, an d 
[Page 73, Line 59] avoid the ignorant.  
[Page 73, Line 60] 200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails 
[Page 73, Line 61] you, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 73, Line 62] 201. Those who are righteous —when an im-
[Page 73, Line 63] pulse from Satan strikes them, they remind themselves, and immediately see clearly.  
[Page 73, Line 64] 202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly 
[Page 73, Line 65] into error, and they never stop short.  
[Page 73, Line 66] 203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, 
[Page 73, Line 67] they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” 
[Page 73, Line 68] Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord.” These are insights from your 
[Page 73, Line 69] Lord , and guidance, and mercy, for a people 
[Page 73, Line 70] who believe.  
[Page 73, Line 71] 204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and 
[Page 73, Line 72] pay attention, so that you may experience 
[Page 73, Line 73] mercy.  
[Page 73, Line 74] 205. And remember your Lord within yourself, 
[Page 73, Line 75] humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the morning and the e vening, and do not be of 
[Page 73, Line 76] the neglectful.  
[Page 73, Line 77] 206. Those who are in the presence of your 
[Page 73, Line 78] Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They 
[Page 73, Line 79] 62 
[Page 74, Line 1] 8.  THE SPOILS   (al-Anfal)  
[Page 74, Line 2] recite His praises, and to Him they bow 
[Page 74, Line 3] down.  

[Page 74, Line 5] 8. THE SPOILS  
[Page 74, Line 6] (al-Anfal ) 
[Page 74, Line 7] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 74, Line 8] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 74, Line 9] 1. They ask you about the bounties. Say, “The 
[Page 74, Line 10] bounties are for Allah and the Messenger.” So 
[Page 74, Line 11] be mindful of Allah, and settle your differ-
[Page 74, Line 12] ences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if 
[Page 74, Line 13] you are believers.  
[Page 74, Line 14] 2. The believers are those whose hearts trem-
[Page 74, Line 15] ble when Allah is  mentioned, and when His 
[Page 74, Line 16] revelations are recited to them, they 
[Page 74, Line 17] strengthen them in faith, and upon their Lord 
[Page 74, Line 18] they rely.  
[Page 74, Line 19] 3. Those who perform the prayer; and from 
[Page 74, Line 20] Our provisions to them, they spend.  
[Page 74, Line 21] 4. These are the true believers. They have high 
[Page 74, Line 22] standing with their Lord, and forgiveness, 
[Page 74, Line 23] and a generous provision.  
[Page 74, Line 24] 5. Even as your Lord brought you out of your 
[Page 74, Line 25] home with the truth, some believers were re-
[Page 74, Line 26] luctant.  
[Page 74, Line 27] 6. Arguing with you about the truth after it 
[Page 74, Line 28] was made clear, as if they were being driven to death as they looked on.  
[Page 74, Line 29] 7. Allah has promised you one of the two 
[Page 74, Line 30] groups —that it would be yours —but you 
[Page 74, Line 31] wanted the unarmed group to be yours. Allah 
[Page 74, Line 32] intends to prove the truth with His words, 
[Page 74, Line 33] and to uproot the disbelievers.  
[Page 74, Line 34] 8. In order to confirm the truth and nu llify 
[Page 74, Line 35] falsehood, even though the guilty dislike it.  
[Page 74, Line 36] 9. When you appealed to your Lord for help, 
[Page 74, Line 37] He answered you, “I am reinforcing you with one thousand angels in succession.”  
[Page 74, Line 38] 10. Allah only made it a message of hope, and 
[Page 74, Line 39] to set your hearts at rest. Victor y comes only 
[Page 74, Line 40] from Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 74, Line 41] 11. He made drowsiness overcome you, as a se-
[Page 74, Line 42] curity from Him. And He sent down upon you water from the sky, to cleanse you with 
[Page 74, Line 43] it, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to 
[Page 74, Line 44] fortify your hearts, and to st rengthen your 
[Page 74, Line 45] foothold.  
[Page 74, Line 46] 12. Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with 
[Page 74, Line 47] you, so support those who believe. I will cast 
[Page 74, Line 48] terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. 
[Page 74, Line 49] So strike above the necks, and strike off every 
[Page 74, Line 50] fingertip of theirs.”  
[Page 74, Line 51] 13. That is because t hey opposed Allah and His 
[Page 74, Line 52] Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His 
[Page 74, Line 53] Messenger —Allah is severe in retribution.  
[Page 74, Line 54] 14. “Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers 
[Page 74, Line 55] there is the suffering of the Fire.  
[Page 74, Line 56] 15. O you who believe! When you meet those 
[Page 74, Line 57] who disbelieve o n the march, never turn your 
[Page 74, Line 58] backs on them.  
[Page 74, Line 59] 16. Anyone who turns his back on them on 
[Page 74, Line 60] that Day, except while maneuvering for bat-
[Page 74, Line 61] tle, or to join another group, has incurred 
[Page 74, Line 62] wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell —
[Page 74, Line 63] what a miserable destination!  
[Page 74, Line 64] 17. It was not you who killed them, but it was 
[Page 74, Line 65] Allah who killed them. And it was not you who launched when you launched, but it was Allah who launched. That He may bestow 
[Page 74, Line 66] upon the believers an excellent reward. Allah 
[Page 74, Line 67] is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 74, Line 68] 18. Such is the case. Allah w ill undermine the 
[Page 74, Line 69] strategy of the disbelievers.  
[Page 74, Line 70] 19. If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come 
[Page 74, Line 71] to you. And if you desist, it would be best for 
[Page 74, Line 72] you. And if you return, We will return; and your troops, however numerous, will not 
[Page 74, Line 73] benefit you. Allah is with the believers.  
[Page 74, Line 74] 20. O you who believe! Obey Allah and His 
[Page 74, Line 75] Messenger, and do not turn away from him 
[Page 74, Line 76] when you hear.  
[Page 74, Line 77] 21. And be not like those who say, “We hear,” 
[Page 74, Line 78] when they do not hear.  
[Page 74, Line 79] 22. The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf 
[Page 74, Line 80] and dumb —those who do not reason.  
[Page 74, Line 81] 23. Had Allah recognized any good in them, 
[Page 74, Line 82] He would have made them hear; and had He 
[Page 74, Line 83] 63 
[Page 75, Line 1] 8.  THE SPOILS   (al-Anfal)  
[Page 75, Line 2] made them hear, they would have turned 
[Page 75, Line 3] away defiantly.  
[Page 75, Line 4] 24. O you who believe! Respond to Allah and 
[Page 75, Line 5] to the Messenger when He calls you to what 
[Page 75, Line 6] will revive you. And k now that Allah stands 
[Page 75, Line 7] between a man and his heart, and that to Him 
[Page 75, Line 8] you will be gathered.  
[Page 75, Line 9] 25. And beware of discord which does not af-
[Page 75, Line 10] flict the wrongdoers among you exclusively; 
[Page 75, Line 11] and know that Allah is severe in retribution.  
[Page 75, Line 12] 26. And remember when you were few , op-
[Page 75, Line 13] pressed in the land, fearing that people may capture you; but He sheltered you, and sup-ported you with His victory, and provided 
[Page 75, Line 14] you with good things —so that you may be 
[Page 75, Line 15] thankful.  
[Page 75, Line 16] 27. O you who believe! Do not betray Allah 
[Page 75, Line 17] and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts, 
[Page 75, Line 18] while you know.  
[Page 75, Line 19] 28. And know that your possessions and your 
[Page 75, Line 20] children are a test, and that Allah possesses 
[Page 75, Line 21] an immense reward.  
[Page 75, Line 22] 29. O you who believe! If you remain con-
[Page 75, Line 23] scious of Allah, He will give you a criterion, 
[Page 75, Line 24] and will remit from you your s ins, and will 
[Page 75, Line 25] forgive you. Allah is possessor of infinite 
[Page 75, Line 26] grace.  
[Page 75, Line 27] 30. When the disbelievers plotted against you, 
[Page 75, Line 28] to imprison you, or kill you, or expel you. 
[Page 75, Line 29] They planned, and Allah planned, but Allah 
[Page 75, Line 30] is the Best of planners.  
[Page 75, Line 31] 31. And when Our revelations are  recited to 
[Page 75, Line 32] them, they say, “We have heard. Had we wanted, we could have said the like of this; 
[Page 75, Line 33] these are nothing but myths of the ancients.”  
[Page 75, Line 34] 32. And they said, “Our God, if this is the truth 
[Page 75, Line 35] from You, then rain down on us stones from 
[Page 75, Line 36] the sky, or visit us with a painful affliction.”  
[Page 75, Line 37] 33. But Allah would not punish them while 
[Page 75, Line 38] you are amongst them. And Allah would not 
[Page 75, Line 39] punish them as long as they seek forgiveness.  
[Page 75, Line 40] 34. Yet why should Allah not punish them, 
[Page 75, Line 41] when they are turning others away from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its cus-
[Page 75, Line 42] todians? Its rightful custodians are the pious; 
[Page 75, Line 43] but most of them do not know.  
[Page 75, Line 44] 35. Their prayer at the House was nothing but 
[Page 75, Line 45] whistling and clapping —so taste the punish-
[Page 75, Line 46] ment for your blasphemy.  
[Page 75, Line 47] 36. Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to 
[Page 75, Line 48] repel from Allah’s path. They will spend it, then it will become a source of sorrow for them, and then they will be defeated. Those 
[Page 75, Line 49] who disbelieve will be herded into Hell.  
[Page 75, Line 50] 37. That Allah may distinguish the bad from 
[Page 75, Line 51] the good, and heap t he bad on top of one an-
[Page 75, Line 52] other, and pile them together, and throw 
[Page 75, Line 53] them in Hell. These are the losers.  
[Page 75, Line 54] 38. Say to those who disbelieve: if they desist, 
[Page 75, Line 55] their past will be forgiven. But if they per-
[Page 75, Line 56] sist—the practice of the ancients has passed 
[Page 75, Line 57] away.  
[Page 75, Line 58] 39. Fight th em until there is no more persecu-
[Page 75, Line 59] tion, and religion becomes exclusively for Al-lah. But if they desist —Allah is Seeing of what 
[Page 75, Line 60] they do.  
[Page 75, Line 61] 40. And if they turn away, know that Allah is 
[Page 75, Line 62] your Protector. The Best Protector, and the 
[Page 75, Line 63] Best Supporter.  
[Page 75, Line 64] 41. And know th at whatever spoils you gain, to 
[Page 75, Line 65] Allah belongs its fifth, and to the Messenger, 
[Page 75, Line 66] and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and to the wayfarer, provided you be-
[Page 75, Line 67] lieve in Allah and in what We revealed to Our 
[Page 75, Line 68] servant on the Day of Distinction, the day when the two armies met. Allah is Capable of 
[Page 75, Line 69] everything.  
[Page 75, Line 70] 42. Recall when you were on the nearer bank, 
[Page 75, Line 71] and they were on the further bank, and the 
[Page 75, Line 72] caravan was below you. Had you planned for 
[Page 75, Line 73] this meeting, you would have disagreed on 
[Page 75, Line 74] the timing, but Allah was to carry out a pre-
[Page 75, Line 75] determined matter, so that those who perish 
[Page 75, Line 76] would perish by clear evidence, and those 
[Page 75, Line 77] who survive would survive by clear evidence. 
[Page 75, Line 78] Allah is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 75, Line 79] 43. Allah made them appear in your dream as 
[Page 75, Line 80] few. Had He made them appear as many, you 
[Page 75, Line 81] would have lost heart, and disputed in the 
[Page 75, Line 82] 64 
[Page 76, Line 1] 8.  THE SPOILS   (al-Anfal)  
[Page 76, Line 2] matter. But Allah saved the situation. He 
[Page 76, Line 3] knows what the hearts contain.  
[Page 76, Line 4] 44. When you met, He made them appear as 
[Page 76, Line 5] few in your eyes, and made you appear fewer 
[Page 76, Line 6] in their eyes, so that Allah may conclude a 
[Page 76, Line 7] pred etermined matter. To Allah all matters 
[Page 76, Line 8] revert.  
[Page 76, Line 9] 45. O you who believe! When you meet a force, 
[Page 76, Line 10] stand firm, and remember Allah much, so 
[Page 76, Line 11] that you may prevail.  
[Page 76, Line 12] 46. And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do 
[Page 76, Line 13] not dispute, lest you falter and lose your 
[Page 76, Line 14] courage. And be steadfast. Allah is with the 
[Page 76, Line 15] steadfast.  
[Page 76, Line 16] 47. And do not be like those who left their 
[Page 76, Line 17] homes boastfully, showing off before the peo-
[Page 76, Line 18] ple, and barring others from the path of Al-
[Page 76, Line 19] lah. Allah comprehends what they do.  
[Page 76, Line 20] 48. Satan made their deeds appear good to 
[Page 76, Line 21] them, and said, “You cannot be defeated by 
[Page 76, Line 22] any people today, and I am at your side.” But 
[Page 76, Line 23] when the two armies came in sight of one an-
[Page 76, Line 24] other, he turned on his heels, and said, “I am 
[Page 76, Line 25] innocent of you; I see what you do not see; I 
[Page 76, Line 26] fear Allah; Allah is severe in punishment.”  
[Page 76, Line 27] 49. The hypocrites and those in whose hearts 
[Page 76, Line 28] is sickness said, “Their religion has deluded 
[Page 76, Line 29] these people.” But whoever puts his trust in 
[Page 76, Line 30] Allah —Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 76, Line 31] 50. If only you could see, as the angels take 
[Page 76, Line 32] away those who disbelieve, strik ing their 
[Page 76, Line 33] faces and their backs: “Taste the agony of the Burning.”  
[Page 76, Line 34] 51. “That is because of what your hands have 
[Page 76, Line 35] committed, and because Allah is not unjust to the servants.”  
[Page 76, Line 36] 52. Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, 
[Page 76, Line 37] and those before them. They rejected the 
[Page 76, Line 38] signs of Allah, so Allah seized them for their 
[Page 76, Line 39] sins. Allah is Powerful, Severe in punishment.  
[Page 76, Line 40] 53. That is because Allah would never change 
[Page 76, Line 41] a blessing He has bestowed on a people unless 
[Page 76, Line 42] they change what is within themselves, and 
[Page 76, Line 43] because Allah is Heari ng and Knowing.  54. Such was the case with the people of Phar-
[Page 76, Line 44] aoh, and those before them. They denied the 
[Page 76, Line 45] signs of their Lord, so We annihilated them 
[Page 76, Line 46] for their wrongs, and We drowned the people 
[Page 76, Line 47] of Pharaoh —they were all evildoers.  
[Page 76, Line 48] 55. The worst of creatures in Allah's view are 
[Page 76, Line 49] those who disbelieve. They have no faith.  
[Page 76, Line 50] 56. Those of them with whom you made a 
[Page 76, Line 51] treaty, but they violate their agreement every 
[Page 76, Line 52] time. They are not righteous.  
[Page 76, Line 53] 57. If you confront them in battle, make of 
[Page 76, Line 54] them a fearsome example for those who fol-
[Page 76, Line 55] low them, that they may take heed.  
[Page 76, Line 56] 58. If you fear treachery on the part of a people, 
[Page 76, Line 57] break off with them in a like manner. Allah 
[Page 76, Line 58] does not like the treacherous.  
[Page 76, Line 59] 59. Let not the disbelievers assume that they 
[Page 76, Line 60] are ahead. They will not escape.  
[Page 76, Line 61] 60. And prepare against them all the power 
[Page 76, Line 62] you can muster, and all the cavalry you can 
[Page 76, Line 63] mobilize, to terrify thereby Allah’s enemies 
[Page 76, Line 64] and your enemies, and others besides them 
[Page 76, Line 65] whom you do not know, but Allah knows 
[Page 76, Line 66] them. Whatever you spend in Allah’s way will 
[Page 76, Line 67] be repa id to you in full, and you will not be 
[Page 76, Line 68] wronged.  
[Page 76, Line 69] 61. But if they incline towards peace, then in-
[Page 76, Line 70] cline towards it, and put your trust in Allah. 
[Page 76, Line 71] He is the Hearer, the Knower.  
[Page 76, Line 72] 62. If they intend to deceive you —Allah is suf-
[Page 76, Line 73] ficient for you. It is He who supported  you 
[Page 76, Line 74] with His aid, and with the believers.  
[Page 76, Line 75] 63. And He united their hearts. Had you spent 
[Page 76, Line 76] everything on earth, you would not have 
[Page 76, Line 77] united their hearts, but Allah united them to-
[Page 76, Line 78] gether. He is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 76, Line 79] 64. O prophet! Count on Allah, and on the be-
[Page 76, Line 80] lievers  who have followed you.  
[Page 76, Line 81] 65. O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If 
[Page 76, Line 82] there are twenty steadfast among you, they 
[Page 76, Line 83] will defeat two hundred; and if there are a 
[Page 76, Line 84] hundred of you, they will defeat a thousand 
[Page 76, Line 85] of those who disbelieve; because they are a 
[Page 76, Line 86] people w ho do not understand.  
[Page 76, Line 87] 65 
[Page 77, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 77, Line 2] 66. Allah has now lightened your burden, 
[Page 77, Line 3] knowing that there is weakness in you. If 
[Page 77, Line 4] there are a hundred steadfast among you, 
[Page 77, Line 5] they will defeat two hundred; and if there are 
[Page 77, Line 6] a thousand of you, they will defeat two thou-
[Page 77, Line 7] sand by Allah’s lea ve. Allah is with the stead-
[Page 77, Line 8] fast. 
[Page 77, Line 9] 67. It is not for a prophet to take prisoners be-
[Page 77, Line 10] fore he has subdued the land. You desire the 
[Page 77, Line 11] materials of this world, but Allah desires the 
[Page 77, Line 12] Hereafter. Allah is Strong and Wise.  
[Page 77, Line 13] 68. Were it not for a predetermined decree 
[Page 77, Line 14] from Allah, an awful punishment would have 
[Page 77, Line 15] afflicted you for what you have taken.  
[Page 77, Line 16] 69. So consume what you have gained, legiti-
[Page 77, Line 17] mate and wholesome; and remain conscious of Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 77, Line 18] 70. O prophet! Say to those you hold prisoners, 
[Page 77, Line 19] “If Allah finds any good in your hearts, He 
[Page 77, Line 20] will give you better than what was taken from 
[Page 77, Line 21] you, and He will forgive you. Allah is Forgiv-
[Page 77, Line 22] ing and Merciful.”  
[Page 77, Line 23] 71. But if they intend to betray you, they have 
[Page 77, Line 24] already betrayed Allah, and He has overpow-
[Page 77, Line 25] ered them. All ah is Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 77, Line 26] 72. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
[Page 77, Line 27] struggled in Allah’s cause with their posses-
[Page 77, Line 28] sions and their persons, and those who pro-vided shelter and support —these are allies of 
[Page 77, Line 29] one another. As for those who believed, but did not emigrate, you owe them no protec-tion, until they have emigrated. But if they 
[Page 77, Line 30] ask you for help in religion, you must come 
[Page 77, Line 31] to their aid, except against a people with 
[Page 77, Line 32] whom you have a treaty. Allah is Seeing of 
[Page 77, Line 33] what you do.  
[Page 77, Line 34] 73. As for those who disbelieve, they are allies 
[Page 77, Line 35] of one another. Unless you do this, there will 
[Page 77, Line 36] be turmoil in the land, and much corruption.  
[Page 77, Line 37] 74. Those who believed, and emigrated, and 
[Page 77, Line 38] struggled for Allah’s cause, and those who gave shelter and support —these are the true 
[Page 77, Line 39] believers. They will have forgiveness, and a 
[Page 77, Line 40] bountiful provision.  75. As for those who believed afterwards, and 
[Page 77, Line 41] emigrated and struggled with you —these be-
[Page 77, Line 42] long with you. But family members are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah. 
[Page 77, Line 43] Allah is Cognizant of everything.  

[Page 77, Line 45] 9. REPENTANCE  
[Page 77, Line 46] (at-Tawbah ) 

[Page 77, Line 48] 1. A declaration of immunity from Allah and 
[Page 77, Line 49] His Messenger to the polytheists with whom 
[Page 77, Line 50] you had made a treaty.  
[Page 77, Line 51] 2. So travel the land for four months, and 
[Page 77, Line 52] know that you cannot escape Allah, and that 
[Page 77, Line 53] Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.  
[Page 77, Line 54] 3. And a proclamation from Allah and His 
[Page 77, Line 55] Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned 
[Page 77, Line 56] the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If 
[Page 77, Line 57] you repent, it will be better for you. But if you 
[Page 77, Line 58] turn away, know that you cann ot escape Al-
[Page 77, Line 59] lah. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.  
[Page 77, Line 60] 4. Except for those among the polytheists with 
[Page 77, Line 61] whom you had made a treaty, and did not vi-
[Page 77, Line 62] olate any of its terms, nor aided anyone 
[Page 77, Line 63] against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to 
[Page 77, Line 64] the end of its term. Allah loves the righteous.  
[Page 77, Line 65] 5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill 
[Page 77, Line 66] the polytheists wherever you find them. And 
[Page 77, Line 67] capture them, and besiege them, and lie in 
[Page 77, Line 68] wait for them at every ambush. But if they re-
[Page 77, Line 69] pent, and perform the prayers, and  pay the 
[Page 77, Line 70] alms, then let them go their way. Allah is 
[Page 77, Line 71] Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  
[Page 77, Line 72] 6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for 
[Page 77, Line 73] protection, give him protection so that he 
[Page 77, Line 74] may hear the Word of Allah; then escort him 
[Page 77, Line 75] to his place of safety. That is becau se they are 
[Page 77, Line 76] a people who do not know.  
[Page 77, Line 77] 7. How can there be a treaty with the polythe-
[Page 77, Line 78] ists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they 
[Page 77, Line 79] are upright with you, be upright with them. 
[Page 77, Line 80] Allah loves the pious.  
[Page 77, Line 81] 66 
[Page 78, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 78, Line 2] 8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they 
[Page 78, Line 3] respect neither kinship nor treaty with you. 
[Page 78, Line 4] They satisfy you with lip service, but their 
[Page 78, Line 5] hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.  
[Page 78, Line 6] 9. They traded away Allah's revelations for a 
[Page 78, Line 7] cheap price,  so they barred others from His 
[Page 78, Line 8] path. How evil is what they did.  
[Page 78, Line 9] 10. Towards a believer they respect neither 
[Page 78, Line 10] kinship nor treaty. These are the transgres-sors.  
[Page 78, Line 11] 11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, 
[Page 78, Line 12] and give the obligatory charity, then they are 
[Page 78, Line 13] your brethren in faith. We detail the revela-
[Page 78, Line 14] tions for a people who know.  
[Page 78, Line 15] 12. But if they violate their oaths after their 
[Page 78, Line 16] pledge, and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief —they have no faith—
[Page 78, Line 17] so that they may desist.  
[Page 78, Line 18] 13. Will you not fight a people who violated 
[Page 78, Line 19] their oaths, and planned to exile the Messen-ger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do you fear them? It is Allah you should fear, if 
[Page 78, Line 20] you are believers.  
[Page 78, Line 21] 14. Fight them. Allah will punish them at your 
[Page 78, Line 22] hands, and humiliate them, and  help you 
[Page 78, Line 23] against them, and heal the hearts of a believ-
[Page 78, Line 24] ing people.  
[Page 78, Line 25] 15. And He will remove the anger of their 
[Page 78, Line 26] hearts. Allah redeems whomever He wills. 
[Page 78, Line 27] Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise.  
[Page 78, Line 28] 16. Or do you think that you will be left alone, 
[Page 78, Line 29] without Allah identifyin g which of you will 
[Page 78, Line 30] strive, and take no supporters apart from Al-
[Page 78, Line 31] lah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah 
[Page 78, Line 32] is well Aware of what you do.  
[Page 78, Line 33] 17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Allah’s 
[Page 78, Line 34] places of worship while professing their dis-belief. These— their w orks are in vain, and in 
[Page 78, Line 35] the Fire they will abide.  
[Page 78, Line 36] 18. The only people to attend Allah’s places of 
[Page 78, Line 37] worship are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice 
[Page 78, Line 38] regular charity, and fear none but Allah. 
[Page 78, Line 39] These are most likely to be guided.  19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims 
[Page 78, Line 40] and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same 
[Page 78, Line 41] as believing in Allah and the Last Day and 
[Page 78, Line 42] striving in Allah’s path? They are not equal in 
[Page 78, Line 43] Allah’s sight. Allah does not guide the unjust 
[Page 78, Line 44] people.  
[Page 78, Line 45] 20. Those w ho believe, and emigrate, and 
[Page 78, Line 46] strive in Allah’s path with their possessions 
[Page 78, Line 47] and their persons, are of a higher rank with 
[Page 78, Line 48] Allah. These are the winners.  
[Page 78, Line 49] 21. Their Lord announces to them good news 
[Page 78, Line 50] of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar-
[Page 78, Line 51] dens wherein they will have lasting bliss.  
[Page 78, Line 52] 22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a 
[Page 78, Line 53] great reward.  
[Page 78, Line 54] 23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves 
[Page 78, Line 55] with your parents and your siblings if they 
[Page 78, Line 56] prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you al-
[Page 78, Line 57] lies himself with them —these are the wr ong-
[Page 78, Line 58] doers.  
[Page 78, Line 59] 24. Say, “If your parents, and your children, 
[Page 78, Line 60] and your siblings, and your spouses, and your 
[Page 78, Line 61] relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, 
[Page 78, Line 62] and a business you worry about, and homes 
[Page 78, Line 63] you love, are more dear to you than Allah, 
[Page 78, Line 64] and His Messenger, and t he struggle in His 
[Page 78, Line 65] cause, then wait until Allah executes His 
[Page 78, Line 66] judgment.” Allah does not guide the sinful people.  
[Page 78, Line 67] 25. Allah has given you victory in numerous 
[Page 78, Line 68] regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great 
[Page 78, Line 69] number impressed you, but it availed you 
[Page 78, Line 70] nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was, 
[Page 78, Line 71] narrowed for you; and you turned your backs 
[Page 78, Line 72] in retreat.  
[Page 78, Line 73] 26. Then Allah sent down His serenity upon 
[Page 78, Line 74] His Messenger, and upon the believers; and 
[Page 78, Line 75] He sent down troops you did not see; and He punished those who disbelieved. Such is the 
[Page 78, Line 76] recompense of the disbelievers.  
[Page 78, Line 77] 27. Then, after that, Allah will relent towards 
[Page 78, Line 78] whomever He wills. Allah is Forgiving and 
[Page 78, Line 79] Merciful.  
[Page 78, Line 80] 28. O you who believe! The polytheists are pol-
[Page 78, Line 81] luted, so let them not approach the Sacred 
[Page 78, Line 82] Mosque after this year of th eirs. And if you 
[Page 78, Line 83] 67 
[Page 79, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 79, Line 2] fear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His 
[Page 79, Line 3] grace, if He wills. Allah is Aware and Wise.  
[Page 79, Line 4] 29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah, 
[Page 79, Line 5] nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah 
[Page 79, Line 6] and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide 
[Page 79, Line 7] by the religion o f truth— from among those 
[Page 79, Line 8] who received the Scripture —until they pay 
[Page 79, Line 9] the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.  
[Page 79, Line 10] 30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” 
[Page 79, Line 11] and the Christians said, “The Messiah is the 
[Page 79, Line 12] son of Allah.” These are their statements, out 
[Page 79, Line 13] of their mouths. They emulate the statements 
[Page 79, Line 14] of those who blasphemed before. May Allah 
[Page 79, Line 15] assail them! How deceived they are!  
[Page 79, Line 16] 31. They have taken their rabbis and their 
[Page 79, Line 17] priests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the 
[Page 79, Line 18] Messiah son of Mary. Although they were 
[Page 79, Line 19] commanded t o worship none but The One 
[Page 79, Line 20] God. There is no god except He. Glory be to 
[Page 79, Line 21] Him; High above what they associate with 
[Page 79, Line 22] Him.  
[Page 79, Line 23] 32. They want to extinguish Allah’s light with 
[Page 79, Line 24] their mouths, but Allah refuses except to 
[Page 79, Line 25] complete His light, even though the disbe-lievers d islike it.  
[Page 79, Line 26] 33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
[Page 79, Line 27] guidance and the religion of truth, in order to 
[Page 79, Line 28] make it prevail over all religions, even though 
[Page 79, Line 29] the idolaters dislike it.  
[Page 79, Line 30] 34. O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and 
[Page 79, Line 31] priests consume people's wealth illicitly, and 
[Page 79, Line 32] hinder from Allah’s path. Those who hoard 
[Page 79, Line 33] gold and silver, and do not spend them in Al-
[Page 79, Line 34] lah’s cause, inform them of a painful punish-
[Page 79, Line 35] ment.  
[Page 79, Line 36] 35. On the Day when they will be heated in the 
[Page 79, Line 37] Fire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their 
[Page 79, Line 38] sides, and t heir backs will be branded with 
[Page 79, Line 39] them: “This is what you hoarded for your-
[Page 79, Line 40] selves; so taste what you used to hoard.”  
[Page 79, Line 41] 36. The number of months, according to Al-
[Page 79, Line 42] lah, is twelve months —in the decree of Al-
[Page 79, Line 43] lah—since the Day He created the heavens 
[Page 79, Line 44] and the earth, of w hich four are sacred. This 
[Page 79, Line 45] is the correct religion. So do not wrong your-
[Page 79, Line 46] selves during them. And fight the polytheists collectively, as they fight you collectively, and 
[Page 79, Line 47] know that Allah is with the righteous.  
[Page 79, Line 48] 37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief —
[Page 79, Line 49] by which those who disbelieve are led astray. 
[Page 79, Line 50] They allow it one year, and forbid it another 
[Page 79, Line 51] year, in order to conform to the number 
[Page 79, Line 52] made sacred by Allah, thus permitting what 
[Page 79, Line 53] Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds seems good to them. Allah does not guid e the 
[Page 79, Line 54] disbelieving people.  
[Page 79, Line 55] 38. O you who believe! What is the matter with 
[Page 79, Line 56] you, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the 
[Page 79, Line 57] cause of Allah,” you cling heavily to the 
[Page 79, Line 58] earth? Do you prefer the present life to the 
[Page 79, Line 59] Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, 
[Page 79, Line 60] com pared to the Hereafter, is only a little.  
[Page 79, Line 61] 39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you 
[Page 79, Line 62] most painfully, and will replace you with an-
[Page 79, Line 63] other people, and you will not harm Him at 
[Page 79, Line 64] all. Allah has power over all things.  
[Page 79, Line 65] 40. If you do not help him, Allah has already  
[Page 79, Line 66] helped him, when those who disbelieved ex-
[Page 79, Line 67] pelled him, and he was the second of two in the cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry, 
[Page 79, Line 68] Allah is with us.” And Allah made His tran-
[Page 79, Line 69] quility descend upon him, and supported 
[Page 79, Line 70] him with forces you did not see, and mad e the 
[Page 79, Line 71] word of those who disbelieved the lowest, 
[Page 79, Line 72] while the Word of Allah is the Highest. Allah 
[Page 79, Line 73] is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 79, Line 74] 41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with 
[Page 79, Line 75] your possessions and your lives in the cause 
[Page 79, Line 76] of Allah. That is better for you, if you only 
[Page 79, Line 77] knew.  
[Page 79, Line 78] 42. Had the gain been immediate, and the 
[Page 79, Line 79] journey shorter, they would have followed 
[Page 79, Line 80] you; but the distance seemed too long for them. Still they swear by Allah: “Had we been 
[Page 79, Line 81] able, we would have marched out with you.” 
[Page 79, Line 82] They damn their own souls, and Allah know s 
[Page 79, Line 83] that they are lying.  
[Page 79, Line 84] 43. May Allah pardon you! Why did you give 
[Page 79, Line 85] them permission before it became clear to you who are the truthful ones, and who are 
[Page 79, Line 86] the liars?  
[Page 79, Line 87] 68 
[Page 80, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 80, Line 2] 44. Those who believe in Allah and the Last 
[Page 80, Line 3] Day do not ask you for exemption from striv-
[Page 80, Line 4] ing wit h their possessions and their lives. Al-
[Page 80, Line 5] lah is fully aware of the righteous.  
[Page 80, Line 6] 45. Only those who do not believe in Allah and 
[Page 80, Line 7] the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in 
[Page 80, Line 8] their doubts.  
[Page 80, Line 9] 46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would 
[Page 80, Line 10] have made preparations for it; but Allah dis-
[Page 80, Line 11] liked their participation, so he held them 
[Page 80, Line 12] back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those 
[Page 80, Line 13] who stay behind.”  
[Page 80, Line 14] 47. Had they mobilized with you, they would 
[Page 80, Line 15] have added only to your difficulties, and they 
[Page 80, Line 16] would have spread rumors in your midst, try-
[Page 80, Line 17] ing to sow discord among you. Some of you 
[Page 80, Line 18] are avid listeners to them. Allah is Aware of 
[Page 80, Line 19] the wrongdoers.  
[Page 80, Line 20] 48. They tried to cause conflict before, and 
[Page 80, Line 21] they hatched plots against you, until the truth 
[Page 80, Line 22] prevailed, and the  command of Allah became 
[Page 80, Line 23] evident —in spite of their dislike.  
[Page 80, Line 24] 49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me, 
[Page 80, Line 25] and do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk into trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the dis-
[Page 80, Line 26] believers.  
[Page 80, Line 27] 50. If something good happens to you, it up-
[Page 80, Line 28] sets them ; and if a calamity befalls you, they 
[Page 80, Line 29] say, “We took our precautions in advance,” and they depart, happy.  
[Page 80, Line 30] 51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except 
[Page 80, Line 31] what Allah has ordained for us; He is our Pro-
[Page 80, Line 32] tector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.  
[Page 80, Line 33] 52. Say, “A re you expecting for us anything 
[Page 80, Line 34] other than one of the two excellences? As for us: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you 
[Page 80, Line 35] with a punishment from Himself, or at our 
[Page 80, Line 36] hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”  
[Page 80, Line 37] 53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or un-
[Page 80, Line 38] willingly, it will not be accepted from you. 
[Page 80, Line 39] You are evil people.”  
[Page 80, Line 40] 54. What prevents the acceptance of their con-
[Page 80, Line 41] tributions is nothing but the fact that they 
[Page 80, Line 42] disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and that they do not approach the prayer except 
[Page 80, Line 43] lazily, and that they do not spend except 
[Page 80, Line 44] grudgingly.  
[Page 80, Line 45] 55. Let neither their possessions nor their chil-
[Page 80, Line 46] dren impress you. Allah intends to torment them through them in this worldly life, and 
[Page 80, Line 47] that their souls depart while they are disbe-
[Page 80, Line 48] lievers.  
[Page 80, Line 49] 56. They swear by Allah th at they are of you. 
[Page 80, Line 50] But they are not of you. They are divisive peo-
[Page 80, Line 51] ple. 
[Page 80, Line 52] 57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a 
[Page 80, Line 53] hideout, they would go to it, rushing.  
[Page 80, Line 54] 58. And among them are those who criticize 
[Page 80, Line 55] you in regard to charities. If they are given 
[Page 80, Line 56] some of it, they become pleased; but if they 
[Page 80, Line 57] are not given any, they grow resentful.  
[Page 80, Line 58] 59. If only they were content with what Allah 
[Page 80, Line 59] and His Messenger have given them, and 
[Page 80, Line 60] said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give 
[Page 80, Line 61] us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger ; 
[Page 80, Line 62] to Allah we eagerly turn.”  
[Page 80, Line 63] 60. Charities are for the poor, and the desti-
[Page 80, Line 64] tute, and those who administer them, and for 
[Page 80, Line 65] reconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and for those in debt, and in the path of Allah, and 
[Page 80, Line 66] for the traveler in need —an obligation f rom 
[Page 80, Line 67] Allah. Allah is All -Knowing, Most Wise.  
[Page 80, Line 68] 61. And among them are those who insult the 
[Page 80, Line 69] Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He lis-tens for your own good. He believes in Allah, 
[Page 80, Line 70] and trusts the believers, and is mercy for 
[Page 80, Line 71] those of you who believe.” Thos e who insult 
[Page 80, Line 72] the Messenger of Allah will have a painful 
[Page 80, Line 73] penalty.  
[Page 80, Line 74] 62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. 
[Page 80, Line 75] But it is more proper for them to please Allah 
[Page 80, Line 76] and His Messenger, if they are believers.  
[Page 80, Line 77] 63. Do they not know that whoever opposes 
[Page 80, Line 78] Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire 
[Page 80, Line 79] of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the su-
[Page 80, Line 80] preme disgrace.  
[Page 80, Line 81] 64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be 
[Page 80, Line 82] revealed about them, informing them of what 
[Page 80, Line 83] 69 
[Page 81, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 81, Line 2] is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah 
[Page 81, Line 3] will bring out what you fe ar.” 
[Page 81, Line 4] 65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were 
[Page 81, Line 5] just joking and playing.” Say, “Were you 
[Page 81, Line 6] making jokes about Allah, His revelations, 
[Page 81, Line 7] and His Messenger?”  
[Page 81, Line 8] 66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved af-
[Page 81, Line 9] ter your belief. If We pardon some of you, We will punish  others, because they are guilty.  
[Page 81, Line 10] 67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women 
[Page 81, Line 11] are of one another. They advocate evil, and 
[Page 81, Line 12] prohibit righteousness, and withhold their 
[Page 81, Line 13] hands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. 
[Page 81, Line 14] The hypocrites are the sinners.  
[Page 81, Line 15] 68. Allah has pr omised the hypocrite men and 
[Page 81, Line 16] hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the 
[Page 81, Line 17] Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their due. And Allah has cursed them. They will 
[Page 81, Line 18] have a lasting punishment.  
[Page 81, Line 19] 69. Like those before you. They were more 
[Page 81, Line 20] powerful than you, and  had more wealth and 
[Page 81, Line 21] children. They enjoyed their share, and you 
[Page 81, Line 22] enjoyed your share, as those before you en-
[Page 81, Line 23] joyed their share. And you indulged, as they 
[Page 81, Line 24] indulged. It is they whose works will fail in 
[Page 81, Line 25] this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who 
[Page 81, Line 26] are the lo sers.  
[Page 81, Line 27] 70. Have they not heard the stories of those be-
[Page 81, Line 28] fore them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and 
[Page 81, Line 29] Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and 
[Page 81, Line 30] the inhabitants of Median, and the Over-
[Page 81, Line 31] turned Cities? Their messengers came to 
[Page 81, Line 32] them with the clear proofs. Allah never 
[Page 81, Line 33] wronged them, but they used to wrong their 
[Page 81, Line 34] own selves.  
[Page 81, Line 35] 71. The believing men and believing women 
[Page 81, Line 36] are friends of one another. They advocate vir-
[Page 81, Line 37] tue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. 
[Page 81, Line 38] These —Allah will have mercy on them. Allah 
[Page 81, Line 39] is Noble and Wise.  
[Page 81, Line 40] 72. Allah promises the believers, men and 
[Page 81, Line 41] women, gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and fine homes in the Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al-
[Page 81, Line 42] lah is even greater. That is the supreme 
[Page 81, Line 43] achievem ent. 
[Page 81, Line 44] 73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers 
[Page 81, Line 45] and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. 
[Page 81, Line 46] Their abode is Hell —what a miserable desti-
[Page 81, Line 47] nation!  
[Page 81, Line 48] 74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing; 
[Page 81, Line 49] but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and they renounced f aith after their submission. 
[Page 81, Line 50] And they plotted what they could not attain. 
[Page 81, Line 51] They were resentful only because Allah and 
[Page 81, Line 52] His Messenger have enriched them out of His 
[Page 81, Line 53] grace. If they repent, it would be best for 
[Page 81, Line 54] them; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful punishment —in this life 
[Page 81, Line 55] and in the Hereafter —and they will have on 
[Page 81, Line 56] earth no protector and no savior.  
[Page 81, Line 57] 75. Among them are those who promised Al-
[Page 81, Line 58] lah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do-
[Page 81, Line 59] nate and be among the upright.”  
[Page 81, Line 60] 76. But when He has given them of His bounty, 
[Page 81, Line 61] they became stingy with it, and turned away 
[Page 81, Line 62] in aversion.  
[Page 81, Line 63] 77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in 
[Page 81, Line 64] their hearts, until the Day they face Him —be-
[Page 81, Line 65] cause they broke their promise to Allah, and because they used to lie.  
[Page 81, Line 66] 78. Do they not know that Allah knows their 
[Page 81, Line 67] secrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah is the Knower of the unseen?  
[Page 81, Line 68] 79. Those who criticize the believers who give 
[Page 81, Line 69] charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who 
[Page 81, Line 70] find nothing to give except their own ef-
[Page 81, Line 71] forts —Allah ridicule s them. They will have a 
[Page 81, Line 72] painful punishment.  
[Page 81, Line 73] 80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or 
[Page 81, Line 74] do not ask forgiveness for them —even if you 
[Page 81, Line 75] ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them. That is because they 
[Page 81, Line 76] disbelieved in Allah and His Mes senger. Al-
[Page 81, Line 77] lah does not guide the immoral people.  
[Page 81, Line 78] 81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their 
[Page 81, Line 79] staying behind the Messenger of Allah. And they hated to strive with their wealth and 
[Page 81, Line 80] their lives in Allah’s way. And they said, “Do 
[Page 81, Line 81] 70 
[Page 82, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 82, Line 2] not venture out in the heat. ” Say, “The Fire of 
[Page 82, Line 3] Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.”  
[Page 82, Line 4] 82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in 
[Page 82, Line 5] recompense for what they used to earn.  
[Page 82, Line 6] 83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, 
[Page 82, Line 7] and they ask your permission to go out, say, 
[Page 82, Line 8] “You will not go out with me, ever, nor will 
[Page 82, Line 9] you ever fight an enemy with me. You were 
[Page 82, Line 10] content to sit back the first time, so sit back 
[Page 82, Line 11] with those who stay behind.”  
[Page 82, Line 12] 84. You are never to pray over anyone of them 
[Page 82, Line 13] who dies, nor are you to stand at his grave-
[Page 82, Line 14] side. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, 
[Page 82, Line 15] and died while they were sinners.  
[Page 82, Line 16] 85. Do not let their possessions and their chil-
[Page 82, Line 17] dren impress you. Allah desires to torment them through them in this world, and their 
[Page 82, Line 18] souls expire while they are disbelievers.  
[Page 82, Line 19] 86. When a ch apter is revealed, stating: “Be-
[Page 82, Line 20] lieve in Allah and strive with His Messenger,” 
[Page 82, Line 21] the prominent among them ask you for ex-emption. They say, “Allow us to stay with 
[Page 82, Line 22] those who stay behind.”  
[Page 82, Line 23] 87. They prefer to be with those who stay be-
[Page 82, Line 24] hind. Their hearts were seale d, so they do not 
[Page 82, Line 25] understand.  
[Page 82, Line 26] 88. But the Messenger and those who believe 
[Page 82, Line 27] with him struggle with their possessions and 
[Page 82, Line 28] their lives. These have deserved the good 
[Page 82, Line 29] things. These are the successful.  
[Page 82, Line 30] 89. Allah has prepared for them gardens be-
[Page 82, Line 31] neath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great victory.  
[Page 82, Line 32] 90. Some of the Desert- Arabs came to make 
[Page 82, Line 33] excuses, asking to be granted exemption, 
[Page 82, Line 34] while those who were untrue to Allah and His 
[Page 82, Line 35] Messenger stayed behind. A painful punish-
[Page 82, Line 36] ment will afflict tho se among them who dis-
[Page 82, Line 37] believed.  
[Page 82, Line 38] 91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the 
[Page 82, Line 39] sick, nor on those who have nothing to give, provided they are true to Allah and His Mes-
[Page 82, Line 40] senger. In no way can the righteous be 
[Page 82, Line 41] blamed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing 
[Page 82, Line 42] to ride with you, and you said, “I have noth-
[Page 82, Line 43] ing to carry you on.” So they went away, with 
[Page 82, Line 44] their eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing 
[Page 82, Line 45] for not finding the means to spend.  
[Page 82, Line 46] 93. But blame is on those who ask you for ex-
[Page 82, Line 47] emption, although they are rich. They are 
[Page 82, Line 48] content to be with those who stay behind. Al-
[Page 82, Line 49] lah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know.  
[Page 82, Line 50] 94. They present excuses to you when you re-
[Page 82, Line 51] turn to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we 
[Page 82, Line 52] do not trust you; Allah has informed us of 
[Page 82, Line 53] you. And Allah will watch your actions, and 
[Page 82, Line 54] so will the Messenger; then you will be re-
[Page 82, Line 55] turned to the Knower of the Invisible and the 
[Page 82, Line 56] Visible, and He will inform you of what you 
[Page 82, Line 57] used to do.”  
[Page 82, Line 58] 95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you 
[Page 82, Line 59] return to them, tha t you may leave them 
[Page 82, Line 60] alone. So leave them alone. They are a dis-
[Page 82, Line 61] grace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for 
[Page 82, Line 62] what they used to earn.  
[Page 82, Line 63] 96. They will swear to you that you may accept 
[Page 82, Line 64] them. But even if you accept them, Allah does 
[Page 82, Line 65] not accept the wicked people.  
[Page 82, Line 66] 97. The Desert -Arabs are the most steeped in 
[Page 82, Line 67] disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to 
[Page 82, Line 68] ignore the limits that Allah revealed to His 
[Page 82, Line 69] Messenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 82, Line 70] 98. And among the Desert -Arabs are those 
[Page 82, Line 71] who consider their contribution to be a fine. 
[Page 82, Line 72] And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes. 
[Page 82, Line 73] Upon them will fall the cycle of misfortune. 
[Page 82, Line 74] Allah is Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 82, Line 75] 99. Yet among the Desert -Arabs are those who 
[Page 82, Line 76] believe in Allah and the Last Day, and con-
[Page 82, Line 77] sider their contribution to be a means to-wards Allah, and the prayers of the Messen-
[Page 82, Line 78] ger. Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah 
[Page 82, Line 79] will admit them into His mercy. Allah is For-
[Page 82, Line 80] giving and Compassionate.  
[Page 82, Line 81] 100. The Pioneers —The first of the Migrants 
[Page 82, Line 82] and the Supporters, and those who followed 
[Page 82, Line 83] them in  righteousness. Allah is pleased with 
[Page 82, Line 84] them, and they are pleased with Him. He has 
[Page 82, Line 85] 71 
[Page 83, Line 1] 9.  REPENTANCE   (at-Tawbah)  
[Page 83, Line 2] prepared for them Gardens beneath which 
[Page 83, Line 3] rivers flow, where they will abide forever. 
[Page 83, Line 4] That is the sublime triumph.  
[Page 83, Line 5] 101. Among the Desert -Arabs around you 
[Page 83, Line 6] there are some hypocri tes, and among the in-
[Page 83, Line 7] habitants of Medina too. They have become 
[Page 83, Line 8] adamant in hypocrisy. You do not know 
[Page 83, Line 9] them, but We know them. We will punish 
[Page 83, Line 10] them twice; then they will be returned to a se-vere torment.  
[Page 83, Line 11] 102. Others have confessed their sins, having 
[Page 83, Line 12] mixed good  deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps 
[Page 83, Line 13] Allah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 83, Line 14] 103. Receive contributions from their wealth, 
[Page 83, Line 15] to purify them and sanctify them with it; and 
[Page 83, Line 16] pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for 
[Page 83, Line 17] them. Allah is Hearing and Knowing . 
[Page 83, Line 18] 104. Do they not know that Allah accepts the 
[Page 83, Line 19] repentance of His servants, and that He re-
[Page 83, Line 20] ceives the contributions, and that Allah is the 
[Page 83, Line 21] Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful?  
[Page 83, Line 22] 105. Say, “Work. Allah will see your work, and 
[Page 83, Line 23] so will His Messenger, and the bel ievers. 
[Page 83, Line 24] Then you will be returned to the Knower of 
[Page 83, Line 25] secrets and declarations, and He will inform 
[Page 83, Line 26] you of what you used to do.”  
[Page 83, Line 27] 106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al-
[Page 83, Line 28] lah’s decree, as to whether He will punish 
[Page 83, Line 29] them, or accept their repentance. Allah is 
[Page 83, Line 30] Aware and Wise.  
[Page 83, Line 31] 107. Then there are those who establish a 
[Page 83, Line 32] mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis-
[Page 83, Line 33] unity among the believers, and as an outpost 
[Page 83, Line 34] for those who fight Allah and His Messenger. 
[Page 83, Line 35] They will swear: “Our intentions are nothing 
[Page 83, Line 36] but good.” But Alla h bears witness that they 
[Page 83, Line 37] are liars.  
[Page 83, Line 38] 108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque 
[Page 83, Line 39] founded upon piety from the first day is wor-
[Page 83, Line 40] thier of your standing in it. In it are men who 
[Page 83, Line 41] love to be purified. Allah loves those who pu-
[Page 83, Line 42] rify themselves.  
[Page 83, Line 43] 109. Is he who founds his  structure upon piety 
[Page 83, Line 44] and acceptance from Allah better, or he who 
[Page 83, Line 45] founds his structure on the brink of a cliff that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with 
[Page 83, Line 46] him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not 
[Page 83, Line 47] guide the unjust people.  
[Page 83, Line 48] 110. The structure which they buil t will remain 
[Page 83, Line 49] questionable in their hearts, until their hearts 
[Page 83, Line 50] are stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 83, Line 51] 111. Allah has purchased from the believers 
[Page 83, Line 52] their lives and their properties in exchange 
[Page 83, Line 53] for Paradise. They fight in Allah’s way, and 
[Page 83, Line 54] they kill and get k illed. It is a promise binding 
[Page 83, Line 55] on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Quran. And who is more true to his promise 
[Page 83, Line 56] than Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex-
[Page 83, Line 57] change —that is the supreme triumph.  
[Page 83, Line 58] 112. Those who repent, those who worship, 
[Page 83, Line 59] those who praise , those who journey, those 
[Page 83, Line 60] who kneel, those who bow down, those who 
[Page 83, Line 61] advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and 
[Page 83, Line 62] those who keep Allah’s limits —give good 
[Page 83, Line 63] news to the believers.  
[Page 83, Line 64] 113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be-
[Page 83, Line 65] lieve to ask forgiveness for the p olytheists, 
[Page 83, Line 66] even if they are near relatives, after it has be-come clear to them that they are people of 
[Page 83, Line 67] Hellfire.  
[Page 83, Line 68] 114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father 
[Page 83, Line 69] only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he 
[Page 83, Line 70] was an enem y of Allah, he disowned him. 
[Page 83, Line 71] Abraham was kind and clement.  
[Page 83, Line 72] 115. Allah would never lead a people astray, af-
[Page 83, Line 73] ter He had guided them, until He makes clear 
[Page 83, Line 74] to them what they should guard against. Al-
[Page 83, Line 75] lah has knowledge of all things.  
[Page 83, Line 76] 116. To Allah belongs the domi nion of the 
[Page 83, Line 77] heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He 
[Page 83, Line 78] causes death. And besides Allah, you have 
[Page 83, Line 79] neither protector, nor supporter.  
[Page 83, Line 80] 117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the 
[Page 83, Line 81] Emigrants, and the Supporters —those who 
[Page 83, Line 82] followed him in the hour of difficulty —after 
[Page 83, Line 83] the hearts of some of them almost swerved. 
[Page 83, Line 84] Then He pardoned them. He is Kind towards 
[Page 83, Line 85] them, Compassionate.  
[Page 83, Line 86] 118. Also towards the three who were left be-
[Page 83, Line 87] hind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is, 
[Page 83, Line 88] 72 
[Page 84, Line 1] 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
[Page 84, Line 2] closed in on them, and their very souls closed 
[Page 84, Line 3] in on them, and they realized that there was 
[Page 84, Line 4] no refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re-
[Page 84, Line 5] deemed them, so that they may repent. Allah 
[Page 84, Line 6] is the Redeemer, the Merciful.  
[Page 84, Line 7] 119. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
[Page 84, Line 8] and be with the sincere.  
[Page 84, Line 9] 120. It is not for the inhab itants of Medina and 
[Page 84, Line 10] the Desert -Arabs around them to stay behind 
[Page 84, Line 11] the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them-
[Page 84, Line 12] selves to him. That is because they never suf-
[Page 84, Line 13] fer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the 
[Page 84, Line 14] cause of Allah, nor do they take one step that 
[Page 84, Line 15] enrages th e disbelievers, nor do they gain an-
[Page 84, Line 16] ything from an enemy, but it is recorded to 
[Page 84, Line 17] their credit as a righteous deed. Allah does 
[Page 84, Line 18] not waste the reward of the righteous.  
[Page 84, Line 19] 121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small 
[Page 84, Line 20] or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is recorded to their credit. That Allah may re-
[Page 84, Line 21] ward them in accordance with the best of 
[Page 84, Line 22] their deeds.  
[Page 84, Line 23] 122. It is not advisable for the believers to 
[Page 84, Line 24] march out altogether. Of every division that 
[Page 84, Line 25] marches out, let a group remain behind, to 
[Page 84, Line 26] gain understanding of the religion, and to no-
[Page 84, Line 27] tify their people when they have returned to 
[Page 84, Line 28] them, that they may beware.  
[Page 84, Line 29] 123. O you who believe! Fight those of the dis-
[Page 84, Line 30] believers who attack you, and let them find 
[Page 84, Line 31] severity in you, and know that Allah is with 
[Page 84, Line 32] the righteous.  
[Page 84, Line 33] 124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of 
[Page 84, Line 34] them say, “Which of you has this increased in 
[Page 84, Line 35] faith?” As for those who believe: it increases 
[Page 84, Line 36] them in faith, and they rejoice.  
[Page 84, Line 37] 125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick-
[Page 84, Line 38] ness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and 
[Page 84, Line 39] they  die as unbelievers.  
[Page 84, Line 40] 126. Do they not see that they are tested once 
[Page 84, Line 41] or twice every year? Yet they do not repent, 
[Page 84, Line 42] and they do not learn.  
[Page 84, Line 43] 127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they 
[Page 84, Line 44] look at one another, “Does anyone see you?” 
[Page 84, Line 45] Then they slip away. Allah ha s diverted their hearts, because they are a people who do not 
[Page 84, Line 46] understand.  
[Page 84, Line 47] 128. There has come to you a messenger from 
[Page 84, Line 48] among yourselves, concerned over your suf-
[Page 84, Line 49] fering, anxious over you. Towards the believ-
[Page 84, Line 50] ers, he is compassionate and merciful.  
[Page 84, Line 51] 129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for 
[Page 84, Line 52] me; there is no god except He; in Him I have 
[Page 84, Line 53] put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime 
[Page 84, Line 54] Throne.”  

[Page 84, Line 56] 10. JONAH  
[Page 84, Line 57] (Yunus ) 
[Page 84, Line 58] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 84, Line 59] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 84, Line 60] 1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
[Page 84, Line 61] Wise Book.  
[Page 84, Line 62] 2. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired 
[Page 84, Line 63] a man from among them: “Warn mankind, 
[Page 84, Line 64] and give good news to those who believe that they are on a sound footing with their Lord”? 
[Page 84, Line 65] The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor-
[Page 84, Line 66] cerer.”  
[Page 84, Line 67] 3. Your Lord is Al lah, who created the heavens 
[Page 84, Line 68] and the earth in six days, then settled over the 
[Page 84, Line 69] Throne, governing all things. There is no in-
[Page 84, Line 70] tercessor except after His permission. Such is 
[Page 84, Line 71] Allah, your Lord —so serve Him. Will you not 
[Page 84, Line 72] reflect?  
[Page 84, Line 73] 4. To Him is your return, altogeth er. The 
[Page 84, Line 74] promise of Allah is true. He originates crea-tion, and then He repeats it, to reward those 
[Page 84, Line 75] who believe and do good deeds with equity. 
[Page 84, Line 76] As for those who disbelieve, for them is a 
[Page 84, Line 77] drink of boiling water, and agonizing tor-ment, on account of their disbe lief. 
[Page 84, Line 78] 5. It is He who made the sun radiant, and the 
[Page 84, Line 79] moon a light, and determined phases for it —
[Page 84, Line 80] that you may know the number of years and 
[Page 84, Line 81] the calculation. Allah did not create all this 
[Page 84, Line 82] except with truth. He details the revelations 
[Page 84, Line 83] for a people who know.  
[Page 84, Line 84] 73 
[Page 85, Line 1] 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
[Page 85, Line 2] 6. In the alternation of night and day, and in 
[Page 85, Line 3] what Allah created in the heavens and the 
[Page 85, Line 4] earth, are signs for people who are aware.  
[Page 85, Line 5] 7. Those who do not hope to meet Us, and are 
[Page 85, Line 6] content with the worldly life, and are at ease 
[Page 85, Line 7] in it, and those who pay no heed to Our signs.  
[Page 85, Line 8] 8. These —their dwelling is the Fire— on ac-
[Page 85, Line 9] count of what they used to do.  
[Page 85, Line 10] 9. As for those who believe and do good deeds, 
[Page 85, Line 11] their Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers 
[Page 85, Line 12] will flow beneath them in the Gardens of 
[Page 85, Line 13] Bliss.  
[Page 85, Line 14] 10. Their call therein is, “Glo ry be to You, our 
[Page 85, Line 15] God.” And their greeting therein is, “Peace.” 
[Page 85, Line 16] And the last of their call is, “Praise be to Al-
[Page 85, Line 17] lah, Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 85, Line 18] 11. If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the 
[Page 85, Line 19] people, as they wish to accelerate the good, 
[Page 85, Line 20] their term would have been  fulfilled. But We 
[Page 85, Line 21] leave those who do not expect Our encounter 
[Page 85, Line 22] to blunder in their excesses.  
[Page 85, Line 23] 12. Whenever adversity touches the human 
[Page 85, Line 24] being, he prays to Us —reclining on his side, 
[Page 85, Line 25] or sitting, or standing. But when We have re-
[Page 85, Line 26] lieved his adversity from him, he goes away, 
[Page 85, Line 27] as though he had never called on Us for trou-
[Page 85, Line 28] ble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of 
[Page 85, Line 29] the transgressors appear good to them.  
[Page 85, Line 30] 13. We destroyed generations before you when 
[Page 85, Line 31] they did wrong. Their messengers came to 
[Page 85, Line 32] them with clear signs, but th ey would not be-
[Page 85, Line 33] lieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.  
[Page 85, Line 34] 14. Then We made you successors on earth af-
[Page 85, Line 35] ter them, to see how you would behave.  
[Page 85, Line 36] 15. And when Our clear revelations are recited 
[Page 85, Line 37] to them, those who do not hope to meet Us 
[Page 85, Line 38] say, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change it.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my 
[Page 85, Line 39] own accord. I only follow what is revealed to 
[Page 85, Line 40] me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor-
[Page 85, Line 41] ment of a terrible Day.”  
[Page 85, Line 42] 16. Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have 
[Page 85, Line 43] recited it to you, and He wou ld not have 
[Page 85, Line 44] made it known to you. I have lived among you for a lifetime before it. Do you not un-
[Page 85, Line 45] derstand?”  
[Page 85, Line 46] 17. Who does greater wrong than someone 
[Page 85, Line 47] who fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His 
[Page 85, Line 48] revelations? The guilty will never prosper.  
[Page 85, Line 49] 18. And they worship, besides Allah, what nei-
[Page 85, Line 50] ther harms them nor benefits them. And they 
[Page 85, Line 51] say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” 
[Page 85, Line 52] Say, “Are you informing Allah about what He 
[Page 85, Line 53] does not know in the heavens or on earth?” 
[Page 85, Line 54] Glorified be He, High above the associations 
[Page 85, Line 55] they ma ke. 
[Page 85, Line 56] 19. Mankind was a single community; then 
[Page 85, Line 57] they differed. Were it not for a prior decree 
[Page 85, Line 58] from your Lord, the matters over which they 
[Page 85, Line 59] had disputed would have been settled.  
[Page 85, Line 60] 20. And they say, “If only a miracle was sent 
[Page 85, Line 61] down to him from his Lord.” Say, “The  realm 
[Page 85, Line 62] of the unseen belongs to Allah; so wait, I am waiting with you.”  
[Page 85, Line 63] 21. When We make the people taste mercy af-
[Page 85, Line 64] ter some adversity has touched them, they 
[Page 85, Line 65] begin to scheme against Our revelations. Say, 
[Page 85, Line 66] “Allah is swifter in scheming.” Our envoys 
[Page 85, Line 67] are writing  down what you scheme.  
[Page 85, Line 68] 22. It is He who transports you across land and 
[Page 85, Line 69] sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a 
[Page 85, Line 70] favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging wind arrives. The waves surge over them 
[Page 85, Line 71] from every side, and they realize that they are 
[Page 85, Line 72] besieged. Thereupon they pray to Allah, pro-
[Page 85, Line 73] fessing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save 
[Page 85, Line 74] us from this, we will be among the apprecia-
[Page 85, Line 75] tive.”  
[Page 85, Line 76] 23. But then, when He has saved them, they 
[Page 85, Line 77] commit violations on earth, and oppose jus-
[Page 85, Line 78] tice. O people! Your violations are against 
[Page 85, Line 79] your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the 
[Page 85, Line 80] present life. Then to Us is your return, and 
[Page 85, Line 81] We will inform you of what you used to do.  
[Page 85, Line 82] 24. The likeness of the present life is this: water 
[Page 85, Line 83] that We send down from the sky is absorbed 
[Page 85, Line 84] by the plants of the earth, from which the 
[Page 85, Line 85] people and the animals eat. Until, when the 
[Page 85, Line 86] earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beau-
[Page 85, Line 87] tified, and its inhabitants think that they have 
[Page 85, Line 88] 74 
[Page 86, Line 1] 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
[Page 86, Line 2] mastered it, Our command descends upon it 
[Page 86, Line 3] by night or by day, and We turn it into stub-
[Page 86, Line 4] ble, as i f it had not flourished the day before. 
[Page 86, Line 5] We thus clarify the revelations for people 
[Page 86, Line 6] who reflect.  
[Page 86, Line 7] 25. Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and 
[Page 86, Line 8] guides whomever He wills to a straight path.  
[Page 86, Line 9] 26. For those who have done good is goodness, 
[Page 86, Line 10] and more. Neither gloom n or shame will 
[Page 86, Line 11] come over their faces. These are the inhabit-
[Page 86, Line 12] ants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.  
[Page 86, Line 13] 27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a 
[Page 86, Line 14] reward of similar evil, and shame will cover 
[Page 86, Line 15] them. They will have no defense against Al-
[Page 86, Line 16] lah—as if their faces  are covered with dark 
[Page 86, Line 17] patches of night. These are the inmates of the 
[Page 86, Line 18] Fire, abiding therein forever.  
[Page 86, Line 19] 28. On the Day when We will gather them al-
[Page 86, Line 20] together, then say to those who ascribed part-
[Page 86, Line 21] ners, “To your place, you and your partners.” Then We will separate between them, and 
[Page 86, Line 22] their partners will say, “It was not us you were 
[Page 86, Line 23] worshiping.”  
[Page 86, Line 24] 29. “Allah is sufficient witness between us and 
[Page 86, Line 25] you. We were unaware of your worshiping 
[Page 86, Line 26] us.” 
[Page 86, Line 27] 30. There, every soul will experience what it 
[Page 86, Line 28] had done previously; and they will be  re-
[Page 86, Line 29] turned to Allah, their True Master; and what they used to invent will fail them.  
[Page 86, Line 30] 31. Say, “Who provides for you from the 
[Page 86, Line 31] heaven and the earth? And who controls the hearing and the sight? And who produces the 
[Page 86, Line 32] living from the dead, and produces the dead 
[Page 86, Line 33] from the living? And who governs the Or-
[Page 86, Line 34] der?” They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you 
[Page 86, Line 35] not be careful?”  
[Page 86, Line 36] 32. Such is Allah, your Lord —the True. What 
[Page 86, Line 37] is there, beyond the truth, except falsehood? 
[Page 86, Line 38] How are you turned away?  
[Page 86, Line 39] 33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true 
[Page 86, Line 40] against those who disobeyed, for they do not 
[Page 86, Line 41] believe.  34. Say, “Can any of your partners initiate cre-
[Page 86, Line 42] ation, and then repeat it?” Say, “Allah initi-
[Page 86, Line 43] ates creation, and then repeats it. How are 
[Page 86, Line 44] you so deluded?”  
[Page 86, Line 45] 35. Say, “Can any of your partners guide to the 
[Page 86, Line 46] truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is He 
[Page 86, Line 47] who guides to the truth more worthy of being 
[Page 86, Line 48] followed, or he who does not guide, unless he 
[Page 86, Line 49] himself is guided? What is the matter with 
[Page 86, Line 50] you? How do you judge?”  
[Page 86, Line 51] 36. Most of them follow nothing but assump-
[Page 86, Line 52] tions; and  assumptions avail nothing against 
[Page 86, Line 53] the truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.  
[Page 86, Line 54] 37. This Quran could not have been produced 
[Page 86, Line 55] by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what preceded it, and an elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt 
[Page 86, Line 56] about it —it is from the Lord of the Universe.  
[Page 86, Line 57] 38. Or do they say, “He has forged it”? Say, 
[Page 86, Line 58] “Then produce a single chapter like it, and call upon whomever you can, apart from Al-
[Page 86, Line 59] lah, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 86, Line 60] 39. In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits 
[Page 86, Line 61] of their knowledge, and whose explanation 
[Page 86, Line 62] has not yet reached them. Thus those before 
[Page 86, Line 63] them refused to believe. So note the conse-
[Page 86, Line 64] quences for the wrongdoers.  
[Page 86, Line 65] 40. Among them are those who believe in it, 
[Page 86, Line 66] and among them are those who do not be-
[Page 86, Line 67] lieve in it. Your Lor d is fully aware of the mis-
[Page 86, Line 68] chief -makers.  
[Page 86, Line 69] 41. If they accuse you of lying, say, “I have my 
[Page 86, Line 70] deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit 
[Page 86, Line 71] of what I do, and I am quit of what you do.”  
[Page 86, Line 72] 42. And among them are those who listen to 
[Page 86, Line 73] you. But can you make the deaf hear, even 
[Page 86, Line 74] though they do not understand?  
[Page 86, Line 75] 43. And among them are those who look at 
[Page 86, Line 76] you. But can you guide the blind, even 
[Page 86, Line 77] though they do not see?  
[Page 86, Line 78] 44. Allah does not wrong the people in the 
[Page 86, Line 79] least, but the people wrong their own selves.  
[Page 86, Line 80] 45. On the Day when H e rounds them up —as 
[Page 86, Line 81] if they had tarried only one hour of a day —
[Page 86, Line 82] they will recognize one another. Those who 
[Page 86, Line 83] 75 
[Page 87, Line 1] 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
[Page 87, Line 2] denied the meeting with Allah will be the los-
[Page 87, Line 3] ers. They were not guided.  
[Page 87, Line 4] 46. Whether We show you some of what We 
[Page 87, Line 5] promise them, or take you, to Us is th eir re-
[Page 87, Line 6] turn. Allah is witness to everything they do.  
[Page 87, Line 7] 47. Every community has a messenger. When 
[Page 87, Line 8] their messenger has come, judgment will be 
[Page 87, Line 9] passed between them with fairness, and they 
[Page 87, Line 10] will not be wronged.  
[Page 87, Line 11] 48. And they say, “When will this promise be 
[Page 87, Line 12] fulfilled , if you are truthful?”  
[Page 87, Line 13] 49. Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit 
[Page 87, Line 14] myself, except as Allah wills. To every nation 
[Page 87, Line 15] is an appointed time. Then, when their time arrives, they can neither postpone it by one 
[Page 87, Line 16] hour, nor advance it.  
[Page 87, Line 17] 50. Say, “Have you considered ? If His punish-
[Page 87, Line 18] ment overtakes you by night or by day, what 
[Page 87, Line 19] part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?”  
[Page 87, Line 20] 51. “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? 
[Page 87, Line 21] Now? When before you tried to hasten it?”  
[Page 87, Line 22] 52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong, 
[Page 87, Line 23] “Taste the t orment of eternity. Will you be re-
[Page 87, Line 24] warded except for what you used to do?”  
[Page 87, Line 25] 53. And they inquire of you, “Is it true?” Say, 
[Page 87, Line 26] “Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot evade it.”  
[Page 87, Line 27] 54. Had every soul which had done wrong pos-
[Page 87, Line 28] sessed everything on earth, it woul d offer it as 
[Page 87, Line 29] a ransom. They will hide the remorse when 
[Page 87, Line 30] they witness the suffering, and it will be 
[Page 87, Line 31] judged between them equitably, and they will 
[Page 87, Line 32] not be wronged.  
[Page 87, Line 33] 55. Assuredly, to Allah belongs everything in 
[Page 87, Line 34] the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the 
[Page 87, Line 35] promise of Allah is true. But most of them do 
[Page 87, Line 36] not know.  
[Page 87, Line 37] 56. He gives life and causes death, and to Him 
[Page 87, Line 38] you will be returned.  
[Page 87, Line 39] 57. O people! There has come to you advice 
[Page 87, Line 40] from your Lord, and healing for what is in the 
[Page 87, Line 41] hearts, and guidance and mercy for the be-
[Page 87, Line 42] lievers.  58. Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them 
[Page 87, Line 43] rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”  
[Page 87, Line 44] 59. Say, “Have you considered the sustenance 
[Page 87, Line 45] Allah has sent down for you, some of which 
[Page 87, Line 46] you made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say, 
[Page 87, Line 47] “Did Allah give you permission, or do you 
[Page 87, Line 48] fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah?”  
[Page 87, Line 49] 60. What will they think —those who fabricate 
[Page 87, Line 50] lies and attribute them to Allah— on the Day 
[Page 87, Line 51] of Resurrection? Allah is bountiful towards 
[Page 87, Line 52] the people, but most of them do not give 
[Page 87, Line 53] thanks.  
[Page 87, Line 54] 61. You do not get into any situation, nor do 
[Page 87, Line 55] you recite any Quran, nor do you do any-
[Page 87, Line 56] thing, but We are watching over you as you 
[Page 87, Line 57] undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, 
[Page 87, Line 58] on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor 
[Page 87, Line 59] is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a 
[Page 87, Line 60] clear  record.  
[Page 87, Line 61] 62. Unquestionably, Allah’s friends have noth-
[Page 87, Line 62] ing to fear, nor shall they grieve.  
[Page 87, Line 63] 63. Those who believe and are aware.  
[Page 87, Line 64] 64. For them is good news in this life, and in 
[Page 87, Line 65] the Hereafter. There is no alteration to the 
[Page 87, Line 66] words of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.  
[Page 87, Line 67] 65. And let not their sayings dishearten you. 
[Page 87, Line 68] All power is Allah’s. He is the Hearer, the 
[Page 87, Line 69] Knower.  
[Page 87, Line 70] 66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the 
[Page 87, Line 71] heavens and everyone on earth. Those who invoke other than Allah do not follow part-
[Page 87, Line 72] ners; they follow o nly assumptions, and they 
[Page 87, Line 73] only guess.  
[Page 87, Line 74] 67. It is He who made the night for your rest, 
[Page 87, Line 75] and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that 
[Page 87, Line 76] are signs for people who listen.  
[Page 87, Line 77] 68. And they said, “Allah has taken a son.” Be 
[Page 87, Line 78] He glorified. He is the Self -Sufficient. His is 
[Page 87, Line 79] everything in the heavens and everything on 
[Page 87, Line 80] earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are 
[Page 87, Line 81] you saying about Allah what you do not 
[Page 87, Line 82] know?  
[Page 87, Line 83] 69. Say, “Those who fabricate lies about Allah 
[Page 87, Line 84] will not succeed.”  
[Page 87, Line 85] 76 
[Page 88, Line 1] 10.  JONAH   (Yunus)  
[Page 88, Line 2] 70. Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us 
[Page 88, Line 3] is their return; then We will make them taste 
[Page 88, Line 4] the severe punishment on account of their 
[Page 88, Line 5] disbelief.  
[Page 88, Line 6] 71. And relate to them the story of Noah, when 
[Page 88, Line 7] he said to his people, “O my people, if my 
[Page 88, Line 8] presence among you and my reminding you 
[Page 88, Line 9] of Allah’s signs is too much f or you, then in 
[Page 88, Line 10] Allah I have put my trust. So come to a deci-
[Page 88, Line 11] sion, you and your partners, and do not let 
[Page 88, Line 12] the matter perplex you; then carry out your 
[Page 88, Line 13] decision on me, and do not hold back.”  
[Page 88, Line 14] 72. “But if you turn away, I have not asked you 
[Page 88, Line 15] for any wage. My wage  falls only on Allah, 
[Page 88, Line 16] and I was commanded to be of those who submit.”  
[Page 88, Line 17] 73. But they denounced him, so We saved him 
[Page 88, Line 18] and those with him in the Ark, and We made 
[Page 88, Line 19] them successors, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. So consider the fate of 
[Page 88, Line 20] those who wer e warned.  
[Page 88, Line 21] 74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to 
[Page 88, Line 22] their people. They came to them with the clear proofs, but they would not believe in an-
[Page 88, Line 23] ything they had already rejected. Thus We set 
[Page 88, Line 24] a seal on the hearts of the hostile.  
[Page 88, Line 25] 75. Then, after them, We sent Mos es and Aa-
[Page 88, Line 26] ron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig-
[Page 88, Line 27] nitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were 
[Page 88, Line 28] sinful people.  
[Page 88, Line 29] 76. And when the truth came to them from Us, 
[Page 88, Line 30] they said, “This is clearly sorcery.”  
[Page 88, Line 31] 77. Moses said, “Is this what you say of the 
[Page 88, Line 32] truth when it has come to you? Is this sor-cery? Sorcerers do not succeed.”  
[Page 88, Line 33] 78. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us 
[Page 88, Line 34] from what we found our ancestors following, 
[Page 88, Line 35] and so that you become prominent in the 
[Page 88, Line 36] land? We will never believe in you.”  
[Page 88, Line 37] 79. Pharaoh said, “Bring me  every experienced 
[Page 88, Line 38] sorcerer.”  
[Page 88, Line 39] 80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said 
[Page 88, Line 40] to them, “Throw whatever you have to throw.”  81. And when they threw, Moses said, “What 
[Page 88, Line 41] you produced is sorcery, and Allah will make 
[Page 88, Line 42] it fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the  
[Page 88, Line 43] corrupt.”  
[Page 88, Line 44] 82. “And Allah upholds the truth with His 
[Page 88, Line 45] words, even though the sinners detest it.”  
[Page 88, Line 46] 83. But none believed in Moses except some 
[Page 88, Line 47] children of his people, for fear that Pharaoh 
[Page 88, Line 48] and his chiefs would persecute them. Phar-
[Page 88, Line 49] aoh was high and mighty in the  land. He was 
[Page 88, Line 50] a tyrant.  
[Page 88, Line 51] 84. Moses said, “O my people, if you have be-
[Page 88, Line 52] lieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if 
[Page 88, Line 53] you have submitted.”  
[Page 88, Line 54] 85. They said, “In Allah we have put our trust. 
[Page 88, Line 55] Our Lord, do not make us victims of the op-pressive people.”  
[Page 88, Line 56] 86. “And de liver us, by Your mercy, from the 
[Page 88, Line 57] disbelieving people.”  
[Page 88, Line 58] 87. And We inspired Moses and his brother, 
[Page 88, Line 59] “Settle your people in Egypt, and make your 
[Page 88, Line 60] homes places of worship, and perform the 
[Page 88, Line 61] prayer, and give good news to the believers.”  
[Page 88, Line 62] 88. Moses said, “Our Lord,  you have given 
[Page 88, Line 63] Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth 
[Page 88, Line 64] in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate 
[Page 88, Line 65] their wealth, and harden their hearts, they 
[Page 88, Line 66] will not believe until they see the painful tor-
[Page 88, Line 67] ment.”  
[Page 88, Line 68] 89. He sa id, “Your prayer has been answered, 
[Page 88, Line 69] so go straight, and do not follow the path of those who do not know.”  
[Page 88, Line 70] 90. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
[Page 88, Line 71] across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur-
[Page 88, Line 72] sued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until, 
[Page 88, Line 73] when he was about to drown, he said, “I be-
[Page 88, Line 74] lieve that there is no god except the One the 
[Page 88, Line 75] Children of Israel believe in, and I am of 
[Page 88, Line 76] those who submit.”  
[Page 88, Line 77] 91. Now? When you have rebelled before, and 
[Page 88, Line 78] been of the mischief -makers?  
[Page 88, Line 79] 92. Today We will preserve your body, so that 
[Page 88, Line 80] you b ecome a sign for those after you. But 
[Page 88, Line 81] most people are heedless of Our signs.  
[Page 88, Line 82] 77 
[Page 89, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
[Page 89, Line 2] 93. And We settled the Children of Israel in a 
[Page 89, Line 3] position of honor, and provided them with 
[Page 89, Line 4] good things. They did not differ until 
[Page 89, Line 5] knowledge came to them. Your Lord will 
[Page 89, Line 6] judge betwee n them on the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 89, Line 7] tion regarding their differences.  
[Page 89, Line 8] 94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed 
[Page 89, Line 9] to you, ask those who read the Scripture be-fore you. The truth has come to you from 
[Page 89, Line 10] your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.  
[Page 89, Line 11] 95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s 
[Page 89, Line 12] revelations, lest you become one of the losers.  
[Page 89, Line 13] 96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is 
[Page 89, Line 14] justified will not believe.  
[Page 89, Line 15] 97. Even if every sign comes to them —until 
[Page 89, Line 16] they see the painful punishment.  
[Page 89, Line 17] 98. If only there was one town that believed 
[Page 89, Line 18] and benefited by its belief. Except for the peo-
[Page 89, Line 19] ple of Jonah. When they believed, We re-
[Page 89, Line 20] moved from them the suffering of disgrace in 
[Page 89, Line 21] the worldly life, and We gave them comfort 
[Page 89, Line 22] for a while.  
[Page 89, Line 23] 99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth 
[Page 89, Line 24] would have believed. Will you compel people 
[Page 89, Line 25] to become believers?  
[Page 89, Line 26] 100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s 
[Page 89, Line 27] leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who 
[Page 89, Line 28] refuse to understand.  
[Page 89, Line 29] 101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and 
[Page 89, Line 30] the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no 
[Page 89, Line 31] avail f or people who do not believe.  
[Page 89, Line 32] 102. Do they expect anything but the likes of 
[Page 89, Line 33] the days of those who passed away before 
[Page 89, Line 34] them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with 
[Page 89, Line 35] you.”  
[Page 89, Line 36] 103. Then We save Our messengers and those 
[Page 89, Line 37] who believe. It is binding on Us to save the  
[Page 89, Line 38] believers.  
[Page 89, Line 39] 104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about 
[Page 89, Line 40] my religion —I do not serve those you serve 
[Page 89, Line 41] apart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one 
[Page 89, Line 42] who will terminate your lives. And I was 
[Page 89, Line 43] commanded to be of the believers.”  105. And dedicate yourself to the  true reli-
[Page 89, Line 44] gion —a monotheist —and never be of the 
[Page 89, Line 45] polytheists.  
[Page 89, Line 46] 106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what 
[Page 89, Line 47] neither benefits you nor harms you. If you 
[Page 89, Line 48] do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.  
[Page 89, Line 49] 107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can 
[Page 89, Line 50] remove it except He. And if He wants good 
[Page 89, Line 51] for you, none can repel His grace. He makes it reach whomever He wills of His servants. 
[Page 89, Line 52] He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.  
[Page 89, Line 53] 108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you 
[Page 89, Line 54] from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is guided for his own  soul; and whoever strays 
[Page 89, Line 55] only strays to its detriment. I am not a guard-
[Page 89, Line 56] ian over you.”  
[Page 89, Line 57] 109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be 
[Page 89, Line 58] patient until Allah issues His judgment, for 
[Page 89, Line 59] He is the Best of judges.  

[Page 89, Line 61] 11. HUD  
[Page 89, Line 62] (Hud ) 
[Page 89, Line 63] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 89, Line 64] the Gracious , the Merciful  
[Page 89, Line 65] 1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses 
[Page 89, Line 66] were perfected, then elaborated, from One 
[Page 89, Line 67] who is Wise and Informed.  
[Page 89, Line 68] 2. That you shall worship none but Allah. “I 
[Page 89, Line 69] am a warner to you from Him, and a bearer 
[Page 89, Line 70] of good news.”  
[Page 89, Line 71] 3. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
[Page 89, Line 72] pent to Him. He will provide you with good sustenance until a stated term, and will be-
[Page 89, Line 73] stow His grace on every possessor of virtue. 
[Page 89, Line 74] But if you turn away, then I fear for you the 
[Page 89, Line 75] punishment of a grievous Day.”  
[Page 89, Line 76] 4. “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable 
[Page 89, Line 77] of all things.”  
[Page 89, Line 78] 5. They wrap their chests to hide from Him. 
[Page 89, Line 79] But even as they cover themselves with their 
[Page 89, Line 80] clothes, He knows what they conceal and 
[Page 89, Line 81] what they reveal. He knows what lies within 
[Page 89, Line 82] the hearts.  
[Page 89, Line 83] 78 
[Page 90, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud ) 
[Page 90, Line 2] 6. There is no  moving creature on earth but its 
[Page 90, Line 3] sustenance depends on Allah. And He knows 
[Page 90, Line 4] where it lives and where it rests. Everything is 
[Page 90, Line 5] in a Clear Book.  
[Page 90, Line 6] 7. It is He who created the heavens and the 
[Page 90, Line 7] earth in six days —and His Throne was upon 
[Page 90, Line 8] the waters —in order to test you—which of 
[Page 90, Line 9] you is best in conduct. And if you were to say, 
[Page 90, Line 10] “You will be resurrected after death,” those 
[Page 90, Line 11] who disbelieve would say, “This is nothing 
[Page 90, Line 12] but plain witchcraft.”  
[Page 90, Line 13] 8. And if We postponed their punishment un-
[Page 90, Line 14] til a stated time, they would say, “What h olds 
[Page 90, Line 15] it back?” On the Day when it reaches them, it 
[Page 90, Line 16] will not be averted from them, and what they 
[Page 90, Line 17] used to ridicule will besiege them.  
[Page 90, Line 18] 9. If We give the human being a taste of mercy 
[Page 90, Line 19] from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he 
[Page 90, Line 20] becomes despairing and ungrateful.  
[Page 90, Line 21] 10. And if We give him a taste of prosperity, 
[Page 90, Line 22] after some adversity has afflicted him, he will 
[Page 90, Line 23] say, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He 
[Page 90, Line 24] becomes excited and proud.  
[Page 90, Line 25] 11. Except those who are patient and do good 
[Page 90, Line 26] deeds —these will have forgiveness and a 
[Page 90, Line 27] great reward.  
[Page 90, Line 28] 12. Perhaps you wish to disregard some of 
[Page 90, Line 29] what is revealed to you, and you may be 
[Page 90, Line 30] stressed because of it, since they say, “If only 
[Page 90, Line 31] a treasure was sent down to him, or an angel 
[Page 90, Line 32] came with him.” You are only a warner, and 
[Page 90, Line 33] Allah is Responsible for all things.  
[Page 90, Line 34] 13. Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say, 
[Page 90, Line 35] “Then produce ten chapters like it, invented, 
[Page 90, Line 36] and call upon whomever you can, besides Al-
[Page 90, Line 37] lah, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 90, Line 38] 14. But if they fail to answer you, know that it 
[Page 90, Line 39] was revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and 
[Page 90, Line 40] that there is no god but He. Will you then 
[Page 90, Line 41] submit?  
[Page 90, Line 42] 15. Whoever desires the worldly life and its 
[Page 90, Line 43] glitter —We will fully recompense them for 
[Page 90, Line 44] their deeds therein, and therein they will not be defrauded.  16. These— they will have nothing but the Fire 
[Page 90, Line 45] in the Here after. Their deeds are in vain 
[Page 90, Line 46] therein, and their works are null.  
[Page 90, Line 47] 17. Is he who possesses a clear proof from his 
[Page 90, Line 48] Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and be-
[Page 90, Line 49] fore it the Book of Moses, a guide and a 
[Page 90, Line 50] mercy? These believe in it. But whoever defies 
[Page 90, Line 51] it from amon g the various factions, the Fire is 
[Page 90, Line 52] his promise. So have no doubt about it. It is 
[Page 90, Line 53] the truth from your Lord, but most people do 
[Page 90, Line 54] not believe.  
[Page 90, Line 55] 18. Who does greater wrong than he who fab-
[Page 90, Line 56] ricates lies about Allah? These will be pre-
[Page 90, Line 57] sented before their Lord, and t he witnesses 
[Page 90, Line 58] will say, “These are they who lied about their 
[Page 90, Line 59] Lord.” Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the 
[Page 90, Line 60] wrongdoers.  
[Page 90, Line 61] 19. Those who hinder others from the path of 
[Page 90, Line 62] Allah, and seek to make it crooked; and re-
[Page 90, Line 63] garding the Hereafter, they are in denial.  
[Page 90, Line 64] 20. Thes e will not escape on earth, and they 
[Page 90, Line 65] have no protectors besides Allah. The pun-
[Page 90, Line 66] ishment will be doubled for them. They have 
[Page 90, Line 67] failed to hear, and they have failed to see.  
[Page 90, Line 68] 21. Those are the ones who lost their souls, and 
[Page 90, Line 69] what they had invented has strayed away from them.  
[Page 90, Line 70] 22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will 
[Page 90, Line 71] be the biggest losers.  
[Page 90, Line 72] 23. As for those who believe and do good 
[Page 90, Line 73] deeds, and humble themselves before their 
[Page 90, Line 74] Lord —these are the inhabitants of Paradise, 
[Page 90, Line 75] where they will abide forever.  
[Page 90, Line 76] 24. The parable  of the two groups is that of the 
[Page 90, Line 77] blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Will 
[Page 90, Line 78] you not reflect?  
[Page 90, Line 79] 25. We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you a 
[Page 90, Line 80] clear warner.”  
[Page 90, Line 81] 26. “That you shall worship none but Allah. I 
[Page 90, Line 82] fear for y ou the agony of a painful Day.”  
[Page 90, Line 83] 27. The notables who disbelieved among his 
[Page 90, Line 84] people said, “We see in you nothing but a 
[Page 90, Line 85] man like us, and we see that only the worst 
[Page 90, Line 86] 79 
[Page 91, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
[Page 91, Line 2] among us have followed you, those of imma-
[Page 91, Line 3] ture judgment. And we see that you have no 
[Page 91, Line 4] advantage o ver us. In fact, we think you are 
[Page 91, Line 5] liars.”  
[Page 91, Line 6] 28. He said, “O my people, Have you consid-
[Page 91, Line 7] ered? If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from 
[Page 91, Line 8] Himself, but you were blind to it, can we 
[Page 91, Line 9] compel you to accept it, even though you dis-
[Page 91, Line 10] like it?” 
[Page 91, Line 11] 29. “O my people! I ask of you no money for it. 
[Page 91, Line 12] My reward lies only with Allah. And I am not 
[Page 91, Line 13] about to dismiss those who believed; they will 
[Page 91, Line 14] surely meet their Lord. And I see that you are 
[Page 91, Line 15] ignorant people.”  
[Page 91, Line 16] 30. “O my people! Who will support me 
[Page 91, Line 17] against  Allah, if I dismiss them? Will you not 
[Page 91, Line 18] give a thought?”  
[Page 91, Line 19] 31. “I do not say to you that I possess the treas-
[Page 91, Line 20] ures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor 
[Page 91, Line 21] do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of 
[Page 91, Line 22] those who are despicable in your eyes that Al-
[Page 91, Line 23] lah will never give them any good. Allah is 
[Page 91, Line 24] Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I would be one of the wrongdoers.”  
[Page 91, Line 25] 32. They said, “O Noah, you have argued with 
[Page 91, Line 26] us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon 
[Page 91, Line 27] us what you threaten us with, if you are truth-
[Page 91, Line 28] ful.”  
[Page 91, Line 29] 33. He said, “It is Allah who will bring it upon 
[Page 91, Line 30] you, if He wills, and you will not be able to 
[Page 91, Line 31] escape.”  
[Page 91, Line 32] 34. “My advice will not benefit you, much as I 
[Page 91, Line 33] may want to advise you, if Allah desires to 
[Page 91, Line 34] confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him 
[Page 91, Line 35] you will be returned.”  
[Page 91, Line 36] 35. Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “If I 
[Page 91, Line 37] made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am innocent of the crimes you commit.”  
[Page 91, Line 38] 36. And it was revealed to Noah: “None of 
[Page 91, Line 39] your people will believe, except those who 
[Page 91, Line 40] have already believed, so do not grieve over  
[Page 91, Line 41] what they do.”  
[Page 91, Line 42] 37. “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and 
[Page 91, Line 43] with Our inspiration, and do not address Me regarding those who did wrong; they are to 
[Page 91, Line 44] be drowned.”  
[Page 91, Line 45] 38. As he was building the ark, whenever some 
[Page 91, Line 46] of his people passed by him, they ridiculed 
[Page 91, Line 47] him. H e said, “If you ridicule us, we will ridi-
[Page 91, Line 48] cule you, just as you ridicule.”  
[Page 91, Line 49] 39. “You will surely know upon whom will 
[Page 91, Line 50] come a torment that will abase him, and upon 
[Page 91, Line 51] whom will fall a lasting torment.”  
[Page 91, Line 52] 40. Until, when Our command came, and the 
[Page 91, Line 53] volcano erupted, We  said, “Board into it a 
[Page 91, Line 54] pair of every kind, and your family —except 
[Page 91, Line 55] those against whom the sentence has already 
[Page 91, Line 56] been passed —and those who have believed.” 
[Page 91, Line 57] But those who believed with him were only a 
[Page 91, Line 58] few. 
[Page 91, Line 59] 41. He said, “Embark in it. In the name of Al-
[Page 91, Line 60] lah shall  be its sailing and its anchorage. My 
[Page 91, Line 61] Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”  
[Page 91, Line 62] 42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves 
[Page 91, Line 63] like hills. And Noah called to his son, who 
[Page 91, Line 64] had kept away, “O my son! Embark with us, 
[Page 91, Line 65] and do not be with the disbelievers.”  
[Page 91, Line 66] 43. He sai d, “I will take refuge on a moun-
[Page 91, Line 67] tain— it will protect me from the water.” He 
[Page 91, Line 68] said, “There is no protection from Allah’s de-
[Page 91, Line 69] cree today, except for him on whom He has 
[Page 91, Line 70] mercy.” And the waves surged between them, 
[Page 91, Line 71] and he was among the drowned.  
[Page 91, Line 72] 44. And it was said,  “O earth, swallow your wa-
[Page 91, Line 73] ters,” and “O heaven, clear up.” And the wa-
[Page 91, Line 74] ters receded, and the event was concluded, and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed: 
[Page 91, Line 75] “Away with the wicked people.” 
[Page 91, Line 76] 45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, “O 
[Page 91, Line 77] My Lord, my son is of  my family, and Your 
[Page 91, Line 78] promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the 
[Page 91, Line 79] wise.”  
[Page 91, Line 80] 46. He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family. 
[Page 91, Line 81] It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me 
[Page 91, Line 82] about something you know nothing about. I 
[Page 91, Line 83] admonish you, lest you be one of the igno-
[Page 91, Line 84] rant.”  
[Page 91, Line 85] 47. He said, “O My Lord, I seek refuge with 
[Page 91, Line 86] You, from asking You about what I have no 
[Page 91, Line 87] 80 
[Page 92, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
[Page 92, Line 2] knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and 
[Page 92, Line 3] have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”  
[Page 92, Line 4] 48. It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace 
[Page 92, Line 5] from Us; and with blessings upon you, and 
[Page 92, Line 6] upon communities from those with you. And 
[Page 92, Line 7] other communities We will grant prosperity, 
[Page 92, Line 8] and then a painful torment from Us will be-
[Page 92, Line 9] fall them.”  
[Page 92, Line 10] 49. These are some stories from the past that 
[Page 92, Line 11] we reveal to you. Neither you, nor your peo-
[Page 92, Line 12] ple knew them befo re this. So be patient. The 
[Page 92, Line 13] future belongs to the pious.  
[Page 92, Line 14] 50. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O 
[Page 92, Line 15] my people, worship Allah, you have no other god besides Him. You do nothing but invent 
[Page 92, Line 16] lies.”  
[Page 92, Line 17] 51. “O my people, I ask you no wage for it; my 
[Page 92, Line 18] wage lies w ith Him who originated me. Do 
[Page 92, Line 19] you not understand?”  
[Page 92, Line 20] 52. “O my people, ask forgiveness from your 
[Page 92, Line 21] Lord, and repent to Him. He will release the 
[Page 92, Line 22] sky pouring down upon you, and will add 
[Page 92, Line 23] strength to your strength. And do not turn 
[Page 92, Line 24] away and be wicked.”  
[Page 92, Line 25] 53. They sai d, “O Hud, you did not bring us 
[Page 92, Line 26] any evidence, and we are not about to aban-
[Page 92, Line 27] don our gods at your word, and we are not 
[Page 92, Line 28] believers in you.”  
[Page 92, Line 29] 54. “We only say that some of our gods have 
[Page 92, Line 30] possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah 
[Page 92, Line 31] to witness, and you to witne ss, that I am in-
[Page 92, Line 32] nocent of what you associate.  
[Page 92, Line 33] 55. Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of 
[Page 92, Line 34] you, and do not hesitate.  
[Page 92, Line 35] 56. I have placed my trust in Allah, my Lord 
[Page 92, Line 36] and your Lord. There is not a creature but He 
[Page 92, Line 37] holds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a 
[Page 92, Line 38] strai ght path.  
[Page 92, Line 39] 57. If you turn away, I have conveyed to you 
[Page 92, Line 40] what I was sent to you with; and my Lord will 
[Page 92, Line 41] replace you with another people, and you will not cause Him any harm. My Lord is Guard-
[Page 92, Line 42] ian over all things.”  
[Page 92, Line 43] 58. And when Our decree came, We saved 
[Page 92, Line 44] Hud and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, and We delivered them from 
[Page 92, Line 45] a harsh punishment.  
[Page 92, Line 46] 59. That was Aad; they denied the signs of 
[Page 92, Line 47] their Lord, and defied His messengers, and 
[Page 92, Line 48] followed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.  
[Page 92, Line 49] 60. And they were pursued by a  curse in this 
[Page 92, Line 50] world, and on the Day of Resurrection. In-
[Page 92, Line 51] deed, Aad blasphemed against their Lord —so 
[Page 92, Line 52] away with Aad, the people of Hud.  
[Page 92, Line 53] 61. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He 
[Page 92, Line 54] said, “O my people, worship Allah, you have no god other than Him. He initiated  you 
[Page 92, Line 55] from the earth, and settled you in it. So seek 
[Page 92, Line 56] His forgiveness, and repent to Him. My Lord 
[Page 92, Line 57] is Near and Responsive.”  
[Page 92, Line 58] 62. They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you 
[Page 92, Line 59] before this. Are you trying to prevent us from 
[Page 92, Line 60] worshiping what our parents worship? We 
[Page 92, Line 61] are in serious doubt regarding what you are 
[Page 92, Line 62] calling us to.”  
[Page 92, Line 63] 63. He said, “O my people, have you consid-
[Page 92, Line 64] ered? If I stand upon clear evidence from my 
[Page 92, Line 65] Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, 
[Page 92, Line 66] who would protect me from Allah, if I diso-
[Page 92, Line 67] beyed Him? You add nothing f or me except 
[Page 92, Line 68] loss.”  
[Page 92, Line 69] 64. “O my people, this is the she -camel of Al-
[Page 92, Line 70] lah, a sign for you. Let her graze on Allah’s 
[Page 92, Line 71] land, and do not harm her, lest an imminent 
[Page 92, Line 72] punishment overtakes you.”  
[Page 92, Line 73] 65. But they hamstrung her, and so He said, 
[Page 92, Line 74] “Enjoy yourselves in your home s for three 
[Page 92, Line 75] days. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”  
[Page 92, Line 76] 66. Then, when Our command came, We 
[Page 92, Line 77] saved Saleh and those who believed with him, 
[Page 92, Line 78] by a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that 
[Page 92, Line 79] day. Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.  
[Page 92, Line 80] 67. And the Scream struck those who trans-
[Page 92, Line 81] gressed, and they became motionless bodies in their homes.  
[Page 92, Line 82] 68. As if they had never prospered therein. In-
[Page 92, Line 83] deed, Thamood rejected their Lord, so away 
[Page 92, Line 84] with Thamood.  
[Page 92, Line 85] 69. Our messengers came to Abraham with 
[Page 92, Line 86] good news. They said, “Peace.” He said,  
[Page 92, Line 87] 81 
[Page 93, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
[Page 93, Line 2] “Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted 
[Page 93, Line 3] calf. 
[Page 93, Line 4] 70. But when he saw their hands not reaching 
[Page 93, Line 5] towards it, he became suspicious of them, 
[Page 93, Line 6] and conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do 
[Page 93, Line 7] not fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.”  
[Page 93, Line 8] 71. His wife was standing b y, so she laughed. 
[Page 93, Line 9] And We gave her good news of Isaac; and af-ter Isaac, Jacob.  
[Page 93, Line 10] 72. She said, “Alas for me. Shall I give birth, 
[Page 93, Line 11] when I am an old woman, and this, my hus-
[Page 93, Line 12] band, is an old man? This is truly a strange 
[Page 93, Line 13] thing.”   
[Page 93, Line 14] 73. They said, “Do you marvel at t he decree of 
[Page 93, Line 15] Allah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are 
[Page 93, Line 16] upon you, O people of the house. He is 
[Page 93, Line 17] Praiseworthy and Glorious.”  
[Page 93, Line 18] 74. When Abraham's fear subsided, and the 
[Page 93, Line 19] good news had reached him, he started plead-
[Page 93, Line 20] ing with Us concerning the people of Lot.  
[Page 93, Line 21] 75. Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.  
[Page 93, Line 22] 76. “O Abraham, refrain from this. The com-
[Page 93, Line 23] mand of your Lord has come; they have in-
[Page 93, Line 24] curred an irreversible punishment.”  
[Page 93, Line 25] 77. And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was 
[Page 93, Line 26] anxious for them, and concerned for them. He said, “This is  a dreadful day.”  
[Page 93, Line 27] 78. And his people came rushing towards 
[Page 93, Line 28] him—they were in the habit of committing 
[Page 93, Line 29] sins. He said, “O my people, these are my 
[Page 93, Line 30] daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Al-
[Page 93, Line 31] lah, and do not embarrass me before my 
[Page 93, Line 32] guests. Is there not one reason able man 
[Page 93, Line 33] among you?”  
[Page 93, Line 34] 79. They said, “You know well that we have no 
[Page 93, Line 35] right to your daughters, and you know well 
[Page 93, Line 36] what we want.”  
[Page 93, Line 37] 80. He said, “If only I had the strength to stop 
[Page 93, Line 38] you, or could rely on some strong support.”  
[Page 93, Line 39] 81. They said, “O Lot, we are the envo ys of 
[Page 93, Line 40] your Lord; they will not reach you. So set out 
[Page 93, Line 41] with your family during the cover of the 
[Page 93, Line 42] night, and let none of you look back, except 
[Page 93, Line 43] for your wife. She will be struck by what will strike them. Their appointed time is the 
[Page 93, Line 44] morning. Is not the morning near?”  
[Page 93, Line 45] 82. And when Our command came about, We 
[Page 93, Line 46] turned it upside down, and We rained down 
[Page 93, Line 47] on it stones of baked clay.  
[Page 93, Line 48] 83. Marked from your Lord, and never far 
[Page 93, Line 49] from the wrongdoers.  
[Page 93, Line 50] 84. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
[Page 93, Line 51] said, “O my people, worship Allah;  you have 
[Page 93, Line 52] no god other than Him. And do not short 
[Page 93, Line 53] measure or short weight. I see you in good 
[Page 93, Line 54] circumstances, but I fear for you the agony of 
[Page 93, Line 55] an encompassing Day.”  
[Page 93, Line 56] 85. “O my people! Give full measure and full 
[Page 93, Line 57] weight, in all fairness, and do not cheat the 
[Page 93, Line 58] people out of their rights, and do not spread 
[Page 93, Line 59] corruption in the land.  
[Page 93, Line 60] 86. What is left by Allah is best for you, if you 
[Page 93, Line 61] are believers. And I am not a guardian over 
[Page 93, Line 62] you.”  
[Page 93, Line 63] 87. They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer 
[Page 93, Line 64] command you that we abandon what our an-cestors  worshiped, or doing with our wealth 
[Page 93, Line 65] what we want? You are the one who is intel-
[Page 93, Line 66] ligent and wise.”  
[Page 93, Line 67] 88. He said, “O my people, have you consid-
[Page 93, Line 68] ered? What if I have clear evidence from my 
[Page 93, Line 69] Lord, and He has given me good livelihood 
[Page 93, Line 70] from Himself? I have no desire to do what I 
[Page 93, Line 71] forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but 
[Page 93, Line 72] reform, as far as I can. My success lies only 
[Page 93, Line 73] with Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I 
[Page 93, Line 74] turn.”  
[Page 93, Line 75] 89. “O my people, let not your hostility to-
[Page 93, Line 76] wards me cause you to suffer what was suf-
[Page 93, Line 77] fered by the people o f Noah, or the people of 
[Page 93, Line 78] Hud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot 
[Page 93, Line 79] are not far away from you.”  
[Page 93, Line 80] 90. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
[Page 93, Line 81] pent to Him. My Lord is Merciful and Lov-
[Page 93, Line 82] ing.”  
[Page 93, Line 83] 91. They said, “O Shuaib, we do not under-
[Page 93, Line 84] stand much of what you say, and we see that 
[Page 93, Line 85] you are weak among us. Were it not for your 
[Page 93, Line 86] 82 
[Page 94, Line 1] 11.  HUD   (Hud)  
[Page 94, Line 2] tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of 
[Page 94, Line 3] no value to us.”  
[Page 94, Line 4] 92. He said, “O my people, is my tribe more 
[Page 94, Line 5] important to you than Allah? And you have 
[Page 94, Line 6] turned your backs on Him? My Lord com-
[Page 94, Line 7] prehend s everything you do.”  
[Page 94, Line 8] 93. “O my people, do as you may, and so will I. 
[Page 94, Line 9] You will know to whom will come a punish-
[Page 94, Line 10] ment that will shame him, and who is a liar. 
[Page 94, Line 11] So look out; I am on the lookout with you.”  
[Page 94, Line 12] 94. And when Our command came, We saved 
[Page 94, Line 13] Shuaib and those who believed with him, by 
[Page 94, Line 14] mercy from Us, and the Blast struck the wrongdoers, and they became motionless 
[Page 94, Line 15] bodies in their homes.  
[Page 94, Line 16] 95. As though they never flourished therein. 
[Page 94, Line 17] Away with Median, as was done away with 
[Page 94, Line 18] Thamood.  
[Page 94, Line 19] 96. And We sent Moses with Our signs and a 
[Page 94, Line 20] clear mandate.  
[Page 94, Line 21] 97. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they fol-
[Page 94, Line 22] lowed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not wise.  
[Page 94, Line 23] 98. He will precede his people on the Day of 
[Page 94, Line 24] Resurrection, and will lead them into the Fire. Miserable is the place he placed them in.  
[Page 94, Line 25] 99. They were followed by a curse in this, and 
[Page 94, Line 26] on the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the 
[Page 94, Line 27] path they followed.  
[Page 94, Line 28] 100. These are of the reports of the towns —We 
[Page 94, Line 29] relate them to you. Some are still standing, 
[Page 94, Line 30] and some have withered away.  
[Page 94, Line 31] 101. We did not wrong them, but they wronged 
[Page 94, Line 32] themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked 
[Page 94, Line 33] besides Allah, availed them nothing when the command of your Lord arrived. In fact, they 
[Page 94, Line 34] added only to their ruin.  
[Page 94, Line 35] 102. Such is the grip of your Lord when He 
[Page 94, Line 36] seizes the town s in the midst of their sins. His 
[Page 94, Line 37] grip is most painful, most severe.  
[Page 94, Line 38] 103. In that is a sign for whoever fears the pun-
[Page 94, Line 39] ishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for 
[Page 94, Line 40] which humanity will be gathered together —
[Page 94, Line 41] that is a Day to be witnessed.  104. We only postpone i t until a predetermined 
[Page 94, Line 42] time.  
[Page 94, Line 43] 105. On the Day when it arrives, no soul will 
[Page 94, Line 44] speak without His permission. Some will be 
[Page 94, Line 45] miserable, and some will be happy.  
[Page 94, Line 46] 106. As for those who are miserable, they will 
[Page 94, Line 47] be in the Fire. They will have therein sighing 
[Page 94, Line 48] and wail ing. 
[Page 94, Line 49] 107. Remaining therein for as long as the heav-
[Page 94, Line 50] ens and the earth endure, except as your Lord 
[Page 94, Line 51] wills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.  
[Page 94, Line 52] 108. And as for those who are happy, they will 
[Page 94, Line 53] be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long 
[Page 94, Line 54] as the heavens and the earth endure, except 
[Page 94, Line 55] as your Lord wills —a reward without end.  
[Page 94, Line 56] 109. So be not in doubt regarding what these 
[Page 94, Line 57] people worship. They worship only as their ancestors worshiped before. We will pay 
[Page 94, Line 58] them their due in full, without any reduction.  
[Page 94, Line 59] 110. We gave Mo ses the Scripture, but it was 
[Page 94, Line 60] disputed. Were it not for a prior word from 
[Page 94, Line 61] your Lord, it would have been settled be-tween them. They are in serious doubt con-
[Page 94, Line 62] cerning it.  
[Page 94, Line 63] 111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in 
[Page 94, Line 64] full for their deeds. He is Aware of everyt hing 
[Page 94, Line 65] they do.  
[Page 94, Line 66] 112. So be upright, as you are commanded, 
[Page 94, Line 67] along with those who repented with you, and 
[Page 94, Line 68] do not transgress. He is Seeing of everything 
[Page 94, Line 69] you do.  
[Page 94, Line 70] 113. And do not incline towards those who do 
[Page 94, Line 71] wrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you 
[Page 94, Line 72] will have no pr otectors besides Allah, and 
[Page 94, Line 73] you will not be saved.  
[Page 94, Line 74] 114. Perform the prayer at the borders of the 
[Page 94, Line 75] day, and during the approaches of the night. The good deeds take away the bad deeds. This 
[Page 94, Line 76] is a reminder for those who remember.  
[Page 94, Line 77] 115. And be patient. Allah will  not waste the re-
[Page 94, Line 78] ward of the virtuous.  
[Page 94, Line 79] 116. If only there were, among the generations 
[Page 94, Line 80] before you, people with wisdom, who spoke 
[Page 94, Line 81] against corruption on earth —except for the 
[Page 94, Line 82] few whom We saved. But the wrongdoers 
[Page 94, Line 83] 83 
[Page 95, Line 1] 12.  JOSEPH   (Yusuf)  
[Page 95, Line 2] pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, 
[Page 95, Line 3] and thus became guilty.  
[Page 95, Line 4] 117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns 
[Page 95, Line 5] wrongfully, while their inhabitants are right-
[Page 95, Line 6] eous.  
[Page 95, Line 7] 118. Had your Lord willed, He could have 
[Page 95, Line 8] made humanity one community, but they 
[Page 95, Line 9] continue to differ.  
[Page 95, Line 10] 119. Except those on whom your Lord has  
[Page 95, Line 11] mercy —for that reason He created them. The 
[Page 95, Line 12] Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell 
[Page 95, Line 13] with jinn and humans, altogether.”  
[Page 95, Line 14] 120. Everything We narrate to you of the his-
[Page 95, Line 15] tory of the messengers is to strengthen your 
[Page 95, Line 16] heart therewith. The truth has come to you  in 
[Page 95, Line 17] this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the be-
[Page 95, Line 18] lievers.  
[Page 95, Line 19] 121. And say to those who do not believe, “Act 
[Page 95, Line 20] according to your ability; and so will we.”  
[Page 95, Line 21] 122. “And wait; we too are waiting.”  
[Page 95, Line 22] 123. To Allah belongs the future of the heavens 
[Page 95, Line 23] and the earth, and to Him all authority goes 
[Page 95, Line 24] back. So worship Him, and rely on Him. 
[Page 95, Line 25] Your Lord is never unaware of what you do.  

[Page 95, Line 27] 12. JOSEPH  
[Page 95, Line 28] (Yusuf ) 
[Page 95, Line 29] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 95, Line 30] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 95, Line 31] 1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
[Page 95, Line 32] Clear Book.  
[Page 95, Line 33] 2. We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, so 
[Page 95, Line 34] that you may understand.  
[Page 95, Line 35] 3. We narrate to you the most accurate his-
[Page 95, Line 36] tory, by revealing to you this Quran. Alt-
[Page 95, Line 37] hough, prior to it, you were of the unaware.  
[Page 95, Line 38] 4. When Joseph said to his father, “O my fa-
[Page 95, Line 39] ther, I saw eleven planets, and the sun,  and 
[Page 95, Line 40] the moon; I saw them bowing down to me.”  
[Page 95, Line 41] 5. He said, “O my son, do not relate your vi-
[Page 95, Line 42] sion to your brothers, lest they plot and 
[Page 95, Line 43] scheme against you. Satan is man's sworn en-
[Page 95, Line 44] emy.  6. And thus your Lord will choose you, and 
[Page 95, Line 45] will teach you the interpretation  of events, 
[Page 95, Line 46] and will complete His blessing upon you and 
[Page 95, Line 47] upon the family of Jacob, as He has com-
[Page 95, Line 48] pleted it before upon your forefathers Abra-
[Page 95, Line 49] ham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing and 
[Page 95, Line 50] Wise.  
[Page 95, Line 51] 7. In Joseph and his brothers are lessons for 
[Page 95, Line 52] the seekers.  
[Page 95, Line 53] 8. When they said, “Joseph and his brother are 
[Page 95, Line 54] dearer to our father than we are, although we 
[Page 95, Line 55] are a whole group. Our father is obviously in 
[Page 95, Line 56] the wrong.  
[Page 95, Line 57] 9. “Kill Joseph, or throw him somewhere in 
[Page 95, Line 58] the land, and your father‘s attention will be 
[Page 95, Line 59] yours. Afterwards, you will be  decent peo-
[Page 95, Line 60] ple.”  
[Page 95, Line 61] 10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but 
[Page 95, Line 62] throw him into the bottom of the well; some caravan may pick him up —if you must do 
[Page 95, Line 63] something.”  
[Page 95, Line 64] 11. They said, “Father, why do you not trust us 
[Page 95, Line 65] with Joseph, although we care for him?”  
[Page 95, Line 66] 12. “Send  him with us tomorrow, that he may 
[Page 95, Line 67] roam and play; we will take care of him.”  
[Page 95, Line 68] 13. He said, “It worries me that you would take 
[Page 95, Line 69] him away. And I fear the wolf may eat him 
[Page 95, Line 70] while you are careless of him.”  
[Page 95, Line 71] 14. They said, “If the wolf ate him, and we are 
[Page 95, Line 72] many, we would be good for nothing.”  
[Page 95, Line 73] 15. So they went away with him, and agreed to 
[Page 95, Line 74] put him at the bottom of the well. And We 
[Page 95, Line 75] inspired him, “You will inform them of this 
[Page 95, Line 76] deed of theirs when they are unaware.”  
[Page 95, Line 77] 16. And they came to their father in the even-
[Page 95, Line 78] ing weeping.  
[Page 95, Line 79] 17. They said, “O father, we went off racing 
[Page 95, Line 80] one another, and left Joseph by our belong-
[Page 95, Line 81] ings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not believe us, even though we are being truth-
[Page 95, Line 82] ful.”  
[Page 95, Line 83] 18. And they brought his shirt, with fake blood 
[Page 95, Line 84] on it. He said, “Your souls  enticed you to do 
[Page 95, Line 85] something. But patience is beautiful, and Al-
[Page 95, Line 86] lah is my Help against what you describe.”  
[Page 95, Line 87] 84 
[Page 96, Line 1] 12.  JOSEPH   (Yusuf)  
[Page 96, Line 2] 19. A caravan passed by, and they sent their 
[Page 96, Line 3] water -carrier. He lowered his bucket, and 
[Page 96, Line 4] said, “Good news. Here is a boy.” And they 
[Page 96, Line 5] hid him as merchandi se. But Allah was aware 
[Page 96, Line 6] of what they did.  
[Page 96, Line 7] 20. And they sold him for a cheap price —a few 
[Page 96, Line 8] coins —they considered him to be of little 
[Page 96, Line 9] value.  
[Page 96, Line 10] 21. The Egyptian who bought him said to his 
[Page 96, Line 11] wife, “Take good care of him; he may be use-
[Page 96, Line 12] ful to us, or we may adopt him a s a son.” We 
[Page 96, Line 13] thus established Joseph in the land, to teach 
[Page 96, Line 14] him the interpretation of events. Allah has 
[Page 96, Line 15] control over His affairs, but most people do 
[Page 96, Line 16] not know.  
[Page 96, Line 17] 22. When he reached his maturity, We gave 
[Page 96, Line 18] him wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward 
[Page 96, Line 19] the righteous.  
[Page 96, Line 20] 23. She in whose house he was living tried to 
[Page 96, Line 21] seduce him. She shut the doors, and said, “I am yours.” He said, “Allah forbid! He is my 
[Page 96, Line 22] Lord. He has given me a good home. Sinners 
[Page 96, Line 23] never succeed.”  
[Page 96, Line 24] 24. She desired him, and he desired her, had he 
[Page 96, Line 25] not seen the p roof of his Lord. It was thus that 
[Page 96, Line 26] We diverted evil and indecency away from him. He was one of Our loyal servants.  
[Page 96, Line 27] 25. As they raced towards the door, she tore his 
[Page 96, Line 28] shirt from behind. At the door, they ran into 
[Page 96, Line 29] her husband. She said, “What is the penalty 
[Page 96, Line 30] for him who desired to dishonor your wife, 
[Page 96, Line 31] except imprisonment or a painful punish-ment?”  
[Page 96, Line 32] 26. He said, “It was she who tried to seduce 
[Page 96, Line 33] me.” A witness from her household sug-
[Page 96, Line 34] gested: “If his shirt is torn from the front: 
[Page 96, Line 35] then she has told the truth, and he is the liar.  
[Page 96, Line 36] 27. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then 
[Page 96, Line 37] she has lied, and he is the truthful.”  
[Page 96, Line 38] 28. And when he saw that his shirt was torn 
[Page 96, Line 39] from the back, he said, “This is a woman's 
[Page 96, Line 40] scheme. Your scheming is serious indeed.”  
[Page 96, Line 41] 29. “Joseph, turn away from thi s. And you, 
[Page 96, Line 42] woman, ask forgiveness for your sin; you are 
[Page 96, Line 43] indeed in the wrong.”  30. Some ladies in the city said, “The gover-
[Page 96, Line 44] nor's wife is trying to seduce her servant. She 
[Page 96, Line 45] is deeply in love with him. We see she has 
[Page 96, Line 46] gone astray.”  
[Page 96, Line 47] 31. And when she heard of th eir gossip, she in-
[Page 96, Line 48] vited them, and prepared for them a banquet, 
[Page 96, Line 49] and she gave each one of them a knife. She 
[Page 96, Line 50] said, “Come out before them.” And when 
[Page 96, Line 51] they saw him, they marveled at him, and cut 
[Page 96, Line 52] their hands. They said, “Good Allah, this is 
[Page 96, Line 53] not a human, this must  be a precious angel.”  
[Page 96, Line 54] 32. She said, “Here he is, the one you blamed 
[Page 96, Line 55] me for. I did try to seduce him, but he re-
[Page 96, Line 56] sisted. But if he does not do what I tell him to 
[Page 96, Line 57] do, he will be imprisoned, and will be one of 
[Page 96, Line 58] the despised.”  
[Page 96, Line 59] 33. He said, “My Lord, prison is mo re desira-
[Page 96, Line 60] ble to me than what they call me to. Unless 
[Page 96, Line 61] You turn their scheming away from me, I may yield to them, and become one of the ig-
[Page 96, Line 62] norant.”  
[Page 96, Line 63] 34. Thereupon his Lord answered him, and di-
[Page 96, Line 64] verted their scheming away from him. He is 
[Page 96, Line 65] the Hearer, the Knower.  
[Page 96, Line 66] 35. Then it occurred to them, after they had 
[Page 96, Line 67] seen the signs, to imprison him for a while.  
[Page 96, Line 68] 36. Two youth entered the prison with him. 
[Page 96, Line 69] One of them said, “I see myself pressing 
[Page 96, Line 70] wine.” The other said, “I see myself carrying 
[Page 96, Line 71] bread on my head, from which the bird s are 
[Page 96, Line 72] eating. Tell us their interpretation —we see 
[Page 96, Line 73] that you are one of the righteous.”  
[Page 96, Line 74] 37. He said, “No food is served to you, but I 
[Page 96, Line 75] have informed you about it before you have 
[Page 96, Line 76] received it. That is some of what my Lord has taught me. I have forsaken the trad ition of 
[Page 96, Line 77] people who do not believe in Allah; and re-
[Page 96, Line 78] garding the Hereafter, they are deniers.”  
[Page 96, Line 79] 38. “And I have followed the faith of my fore-
[Page 96, Line 80] fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is 
[Page 96, Line 81] not for us to associate anything with Allah. 
[Page 96, Line 82] This is by virtue of Allah’ s grace upon us and 
[Page 96, Line 83] upon the people, but most people do not give thanks.  
[Page 96, Line 84] 39. “O My fellow inmates, are diverse lords 
[Page 96, Line 85] better, or Allah, the One, the Supreme?”  
[Page 96, Line 86] 85 
[Page 97, Line 1] 12.  JOSEPH   (Yusuf)  
[Page 97, Line 2] 40. “You do not worship, besides Him, except 
[Page 97, Line 3] names you have named, you and your ances-
[Page 97, Line 4] tors, for whi ch Allah has sent down no au-
[Page 97, Line 5] thority. Judgment belongs to none but Allah. 
[Page 97, Line 6] He has commanded that you worship none 
[Page 97, Line 7] but Him. This is the right religion, but most 
[Page 97, Line 8] people do not know.  
[Page 97, Line 9] 41. “O my fellow inmates! One of you will 
[Page 97, Line 10] serve his master wine; while the oth er will be 
[Page 97, Line 11] crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. 
[Page 97, Line 12] Thus the matter you are inquiring about is 
[Page 97, Line 13] settled.”  
[Page 97, Line 14] 42. And he said to the one he thought would 
[Page 97, Line 15] be released, “Mention me to your master.” 
[Page 97, Line 16] But Satan caused him to forget mentioning him to his master, so he remained in prison 
[Page 97, Line 17] for several years.  
[Page 97, Line 18] 43. The king said, “I see seven fat cows being 
[Page 97, Line 19] eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green spikes, and others dried up. O elders, explain 
[Page 97, Line 20] to me my vision, if you are able to interpret 
[Page 97, Line 21] visions.”  
[Page 97, Line 22] 44. They said, “ Jumbles of dreams, and we 
[Page 97, Line 23] know nothing of the interpretation of 
[Page 97, Line 24] dreams.”  
[Page 97, Line 25] 45. The one who was released said, having re-
[Page 97, Line 26] membered after a time, “I will inform you of 
[Page 97, Line 27] its interpretation, so send me out.”  
[Page 97, Line 28] 46. “Joseph, O man of truth, inform us con-
[Page 97, Line 29] cerning seven f at cows being eaten by seven 
[Page 97, Line 30] lean ones, and seven green spikes, and others 
[Page 97, Line 31] dried up, so that I may return to the people, 
[Page 97, Line 32] so that they may know.”  
[Page 97, Line 33] 47. He said, “You will farm for seven consecu-
[Page 97, Line 34] tive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it 
[Page 97, Line 35] in its spikes, exce pt for the little that you eat.”  
[Page 97, Line 36] 48. Then after that will come seven difficult 
[Page 97, Line 37] ones, which will consume what you have 
[Page 97, Line 38] stored for them, except for the little that you 
[Page 97, Line 39] have preserved.  
[Page 97, Line 40] 49. Then after that will come a year that brings 
[Page 97, Line 41] relief to the people, and  during which they 
[Page 97, Line 42] will press.  
[Page 97, Line 43] 50. The king said, “Bring him to me.” And 
[Page 97, Line 44] when the envoy came to him, he said, “Go back to your master, and ask him about the 
[Page 97, Line 45] intentions of the women who cut their hands; 
[Page 97, Line 46] my Lord is well aware of their schemes.”  
[Page 97, Line 47] 51. He said, “What was the matter with you, 
[Page 97, Line 48] women, when you tried to seduce Joseph?” 
[Page 97, Line 49] They said, “Allah forbid! We knew of no evil 
[Page 97, Line 50] committed by him.” The governor’s wife then 
[Page 97, Line 51] said, “Now the truth is out. It was I who tried 
[Page 97, Line 52] to seduce him, and he is telling the truth.”  
[Page 97, Line 53] 52. “This is that he may know that I did not 
[Page 97, Line 54] betray him in secret, and that Allah does not 
[Page 97, Line 55] guide the scheming of the betrayers.”  
[Page 97, Line 56] 53. “Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul 
[Page 97, Line 57] commands evil, except those on whom my 
[Page 97, Line 58] Lord has mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgivin g 
[Page 97, Line 59] and Merciful.”  
[Page 97, Line 60] 54. The king said, “Bring him to me, and I will 
[Page 97, Line 61] reserve him for myself.” And when he spoke to him, he said, “This day you are with us es-
[Page 97, Line 62] tablished and secure.”  
[Page 97, Line 63] 55. He said, “Put me in charge of the store-
[Page 97, Line 64] houses of the land; I am honest and knowl-
[Page 97, Line 65] edgeable.”  
[Page 97, Line 66] 56. And thus We established Joseph in the 
[Page 97, Line 67] land, to live therein wherever he wished. We touch with Our mercy whomever We will, 
[Page 97, Line 68] and We never waste the reward of the right-
[Page 97, Line 69] eous.  
[Page 97, Line 70] 57. But the reward of the Hereafter is better for 
[Page 97, Line 71] those who believ e and observed piety.  
[Page 97, Line 72] 58. And Joseph's brothers came, and entered 
[Page 97, Line 73] into his presence. He recognized them, but they did not recognize him.  
[Page 97, Line 74] 59. When he provided them with their provi-
[Page 97, Line 75] sions, he said, “Bring me a brother of yours 
[Page 97, Line 76] from your father. Do you not see  that I fill up 
[Page 97, Line 77] the measure, and I am the best of hosts?”  
[Page 97, Line 78] 60. “But if you do not bring him to me, you will 
[Page 97, Line 79] have no measure from me, and you will not 
[Page 97, Line 80] come near me.”  
[Page 97, Line 81] 61. They said, “We will solicit him from his fa-
[Page 97, Line 82] ther. We will surely do.”  
[Page 97, Line 83] 62. He said to his servants, “Put their goods in 
[Page 97, Line 84] their saddlebags; perhaps they will recognize 
[Page 97, Line 85] 86 
[Page 98, Line 1] 12.  JOSEPH   (Yusuf)  
[Page 98, Line 2] them when they return to their families, and 
[Page 98, Line 3] maybe they will come back.”  
[Page 98, Line 4] 63. When they returned to their father, they 
[Page 98, Line 5] said, “O father, we were denied measure, but 
[Page 98, Line 6] send our brother with us, and we will obtain 
[Page 98, Line 7] measure. We will take care of him.”  
[Page 98, Line 8] 64. He said, “Shall I trust you with him, as I 
[Page 98, Line 9] trusted you with his brother before? Allah is 
[Page 98, Line 10] the Best Guardian, and He is the Most Mer-
[Page 98, Line 11] ciful of the merciful.”  
[Page 98, Line 12] 65. And when they opened their bag gage, they 
[Page 98, Line 13] found that their goods were returned to 
[Page 98, Line 14] them. They said, “Father, what more do we want? Here are our goods, returned to us. We 
[Page 98, Line 15] will provide for our family, and protect our 
[Page 98, Line 16] brother, and have an additional camel -load. 
[Page 98, Line 17] This is easy commerce.”  
[Page 98, Line 18] 66. He said, “I will not send him with you, un-
[Page 98, Line 19] less you give me a pledge before Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you get trapped.” And when they gave him their 
[Page 98, Line 20] pledge, he said, “Allah is witness to what we 
[Page 98, Line 21] say.”  
[Page 98, Line 22] 67. And he said, “O my sons, do no t enter by 
[Page 98, Line 23] one gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot 
[Page 98, Line 24] avail you anything against Allah. The deci-
[Page 98, Line 25] sion rests only with Allah. On Him I rely, and 
[Page 98, Line 26] on Him let the reliant rely.”  
[Page 98, Line 27] 68. And when they entered as their father had 
[Page 98, Line 28] instructed them, it did not ava il them any-
[Page 98, Line 29] thing against Allah; it was just a need in the 
[Page 98, Line 30] soul of Jacob, which he carried out. He was a 
[Page 98, Line 31] person of knowledge inasmuch as We had 
[Page 98, Line 32] taught him, but most people do not know.  
[Page 98, Line 33] 69. And when they entered into the presence 
[Page 98, Line 34] of Joseph, he embraced his b rother, and said, 
[Page 98, Line 35] “I am your brother; do not be saddened by what they used to do.”  
[Page 98, Line 36] 70. Then, when he provided them with their 
[Page 98, Line 37] provisions, he placed the drinking -cup in his 
[Page 98, Line 38] brother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer 
[Page 98, Line 39] called out, “O people of the caravan, you are  
[Page 98, Line 40] thieves.”  
[Page 98, Line 41] 71. They said, as they came towards them, 
[Page 98, Line 42] “What are you missing?”  72. They said, “We are missing the king’s gob-
[Page 98, Line 43] let. Whoever brings it will have a camel -load; 
[Page 98, Line 44] and I personally guarantee it.”  
[Page 98, Line 45] 73. They said, “By Allah, you know we did not 
[Page 98, Line 46] come to c ause trouble in the land, and we are 
[Page 98, Line 47] not thieves.”  
[Page 98, Line 48] 74. They said, “What shall be his punishment, 
[Page 98, Line 49] if you are lying?”  
[Page 98, Line 50] 75. They said, “His punishment, if it is found 
[Page 98, Line 51] in his bag: he will belong to you. Thus we pe-
[Page 98, Line 52] nalize the guilty.”  
[Page 98, Line 53] 76. So he began with their b ags, before his 
[Page 98, Line 54] brother's bag. Then he pulled it out of his 
[Page 98, Line 55] brother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Jo-seph; he could not have detained his brother 
[Page 98, Line 56] under the king’s law, unless Allah so willed. 
[Page 98, Line 57] We elevate by degrees whomever We will; 
[Page 98, Line 58] and above every perso n of knowledge, there 
[Page 98, Line 59] is one more learned.  
[Page 98, Line 60] 77. They said, “If he has stolen, a brother of his 
[Page 98, Line 61] has stolen before.” But Joseph kept it to him-self, and did not reveal it to them. He said, 
[Page 98, Line 62] “You are in a worse situation, and Allah is 
[Page 98, Line 63] Aware of what you allege.”  
[Page 98, Line 64] 78. They said, “O noble prince, he has a father, 
[Page 98, Line 65] a very old man, so take one of us in his place. 
[Page 98, Line 66] We see that you are a good person.”  
[Page 98, Line 67] 79. He said, “Allah forbid that we should arrest 
[Page 98, Line 68] anyone except him in whose possession we 
[Page 98, Line 69] found our property; for then we w ould be un-
[Page 98, Line 70] just.”  
[Page 98, Line 71] 80. And when they despaired of him, they con-
[Page 98, Line 72] ferred privately. Their eldest said, “Don’t you 
[Page 98, Line 73] know that your father received a pledge from 
[Page 98, Line 74] you before Allah, and in the past you failed 
[Page 98, Line 75] with regard to Joseph? I will not leave this 
[Page 98, Line 76] land until m y father permits me, or Allah de-
[Page 98, Line 77] cides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders.”  
[Page 98, Line 78] 81. “Go back to your father, and say, ‘Our fa-
[Page 98, Line 79] ther, your son has stolen. We testify only to 
[Page 98, Line 80] what we know, and we could not have pre-
[Page 98, Line 81] vented the unforeseen.’”  
[Page 98, Line 82] 82. “Ask the town wher e we were, and the car-
[Page 98, Line 83] avan in which we came. We are being truth-
[Page 98, Line 84] ful.”  
[Page 98, Line 85] 87 
[Page 99, Line 1] 12.  JOSEPH   (Yusuf)  
[Page 99, Line 2] 83. He said, “Rather, your souls have contrived 
[Page 99, Line 3] something for you. Patience is a virtue. Per-
[Page 99, Line 4] haps Allah will bring them all back to me. He 
[Page 99, Line 5] is the Knowing, the Wise.”  
[Page 99, Line 6] 84. Then he turned away from them, and said, 
[Page 99, Line 7] “O my bitterness for Joseph.” And his eyes 
[Page 99, Line 8] turned white from sorrow, and he became 
[Page 99, Line 9] depressed.  
[Page 99, Line 10] 85. They said, “By Allah, you will not stop re-
[Page 99, Line 11] membering Joseph, until you have ruined 
[Page 99, Line 12] your health, or you have passed away.”  
[Page 99, Line 13] 86. He said, “ I only complain of my grief and 
[Page 99, Line 14] sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.”  
[Page 99, Line 15] 87. “O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph 
[Page 99, Line 16] and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's 
[Page 99, Line 17] comfort. None despairs of Allah's comfort 
[Page 99, Line 18] except the disbelieving peopl e.” 
[Page 99, Line 19] 88. Then, when they entered into his presence, 
[Page 99, Line 20] they said, “Mighty governor, adversity has 
[Page 99, Line 21] befallen us, and our family. We have brought scant merchandise. But give us full measure, 
[Page 99, Line 22] and be charitable towards us —Allah rewards 
[Page 99, Line 23] the charitable.”  
[Page 99, Line 24] 89. He said,  “Do you realize what you did with 
[Page 99, Line 25] Joseph and his brother, in your ignorance?”  
[Page 99, Line 26] 90. They said, “Is that you, Joseph?” He said, “I 
[Page 99, Line 27] am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has 
[Page 99, Line 28] been gracious to us. He who practices piety and patience —Allah never fails to reward the 
[Page 99, Line 29] righteous.”  
[Page 99, Line 30] 91. They said, “By Allah, Allah has preferred 
[Page 99, Line 31] you over us. We were definitely in the 
[Page 99, Line 32] wrong.”  
[Page 99, Line 33] 92. He said, “There is no blame upon you to-
[Page 99, Line 34] day. Allah will forgive you. He is the Most 
[Page 99, Line 35] Merciful of the merciful.”  
[Page 99, Line 36] 93. “Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my 
[Page 99, Line 37] father’s face, and he will recover his sight. 
[Page 99, Line 38] And bring your whole family to me.”  
[Page 99, Line 39] 94. As the caravan set out, their father said, “I 
[Page 99, Line 40] sense the presence of Joseph, though you may 
[Page 99, Line 41] think I am senile.”  
[Page 99, Line 42] 95. They said, “By Allah, you are still in your 
[Page 99, Line 43] old confusion.”  96. Then, when the bearer of good news ar-
[Page 99, Line 44] rived, he laid it over his face, and he regained 
[Page 99, Line 45] his sight. He said, “Did I not say to you that I 
[Page 99, Line 46] know from Allah what you do not know?”  
[Page 99, Line 47] 97. They said, “Father, pray for the forgiveness 
[Page 99, Line 48] of ou r sins; we were indeed at fault.”  
[Page 99, Line 49] 98. He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you. 
[Page 99, Line 50] He is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.”  
[Page 99, Line 51] 99. Then, when they entered into the presence 
[Page 99, Line 52] of Joseph, he embraced his parents, and said, “Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe and sec ure.”  
[Page 99, Line 53] 100. And he elevated his parents on the throne, 
[Page 99, Line 54] and they fell prostrate before him. He said, 
[Page 99, Line 55] “Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of long ago. My Lord has made it come true. He 
[Page 99, Line 56] has blessed me, when he released me from 
[Page 99, Line 57] prison, and brought you  out of the wilder-
[Page 99, Line 58] ness, after the devil had sown conflict be-
[Page 99, Line 59] tween me and my brothers. My Lord is Most 
[Page 99, Line 60] Kind towards whomever He wills. He is the 
[Page 99, Line 61] All-knowing, the Most Wise.”  
[Page 99, Line 62] 101. “My Lord, You have given me some au-
[Page 99, Line 63] thority, and taught me some interpretation of 
[Page 99, Line 64] events. Initiator of the heavens and the earth; 
[Page 99, Line 65] You are my Protector in this life and in the 
[Page 99, Line 66] Hereafter. Receive my soul in submission, 
[Page 99, Line 67] and unite me with the righteous.”  
[Page 99, Line 68] 102. This is news from the past that We reveal 
[Page 99, Line 69] to you. You were not present with the m when 
[Page 99, Line 70] they plotted and agreed on a plan.  
[Page 99, Line 71] 103. But most people, for all your eagerness, are 
[Page 99, Line 72] not believers.  
[Page 99, Line 73] 104. You ask them no wage for it. It is only a 
[Page 99, Line 74] reminder for all mankind.  
[Page 99, Line 75] 105. How many a sign in the heavens and the 
[Page 99, Line 76] earth do they pass by, paying no  attention to 
[Page 99, Line 77] them?  
[Page 99, Line 78] 106. And most of them do not believe in Allah 
[Page 99, Line 79] unless they associate others.  
[Page 99, Line 80] 107. Do they feel secure that a covering of Al-
[Page 99, Line 81] lah’s punishment will not come upon them, 
[Page 99, Line 82] or that the Hour will not come upon them 
[Page 99, Line 83] suddenly, while they are unaware?  
[Page 99, Line 84] 108. Say, “This is my way; I invite to Allah, 
[Page 99, Line 85] based on clear knowledge —I and whoever 
[Page 99, Line 86] 88 
[Page 100, Line 1] 13.  THUNDER   (ar-Ra’d)  
[Page 100, Line 2] follows me. Glory be to Allah; and I am not 
[Page 100, Line 3] of the polytheists.”  
[Page 100, Line 4] 109. We did not send before you except men, 
[Page 100, Line 5] whom We inspired, from the people of the 
[Page 100, Line 6] towns. Have they not roamed the earth and 
[Page 100, Line 7] seen the consequences for those before them? 
[Page 100, Line 8] The Home of the Hereafter is better for those 
[Page 100, Line 9] who are righteous. Do you not understand?  
[Page 100, Line 10] 110. Until, when the messengers have des-
[Page 100, Line 11] paired, and thought that they were rejected, 
[Page 100, Line 12] Our help  came to them. We save whomever 
[Page 100, Line 13] We will, and Our severity is not averted from 
[Page 100, Line 14] the guilty people.  
[Page 100, Line 15] 111. In their stories is a lesson for those who 
[Page 100, Line 16] possess intelligence. This is not a fabricated 
[Page 100, Line 17] tale, but a confirmation of what came before it, and a detailed explanation of all things, 
[Page 100, Line 18] and guidance, and mercy for people who be-
[Page 100, Line 19] lieve.  

[Page 100, Line 21] 13. THUNDER  
[Page 100, Line 22] (ar-Ra’d ) 
[Page 100, Line 23] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 100, Line 24] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 100, Line 25] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the signs of 
[Page 100, Line 26] the Scripture. What is revealed to you from 
[Page 100, Line 27] your Lord is the truth, but most people do not 
[Page 100, Line 28] believe.  
[Page 100, Line 29] 2. Allah is He who raised the heavens without 
[Page 100, Line 30] pillars that you can see, and then settled on 
[Page 100, Line 31] the Throne. And He regulated the sun and 
[Page 100, Line 32] the moon, each running for a specified pe-
[Page 100, Line 33] riod. He manages all affairs, and He explai ns 
[Page 100, Line 34] the signs, that you may be certain of the meet-
[Page 100, Line 35] ing with your Lord.  
[Page 100, Line 36] 3. And it is He who spread the earth, and 
[Page 100, Line 37] placed in it mountains and rivers. And He 
[Page 100, Line 38] placed in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes 
[Page 100, Line 39] the night to overlap the day. In that are signs 
[Page 100, Line 40] for pe ople who reflect.  
[Page 100, Line 41] 4. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens 
[Page 100, Line 42] of vines, and crops, and date -palms, from the 
[Page 100, Line 43] same root or from distinct roots, irrigated 
[Page 100, Line 44] with the same water. We make some taste better than others. In that are proofs for peo-
[Page 100, Line 45] ple who reason.  
[Page 100, Line 46] 5. Should you wonder —the real wonder is 
[Page 100, Line 47] their saying: “When we have become dust, 
[Page 100, Line 48] will we be in a new creation?” Those are they 
[Page 100, Line 49] who defied their Lord. Those are they who 
[Page 100, Line 50] will have yokes around their necks. Those are 
[Page 100, Line 51] the inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re-
[Page 100, Line 52] main forever.  
[Page 100, Line 53] 6. And they urge you to hasten evil before 
[Page 100, Line 54] good, though examples have passed away be-
[Page 100, Line 55] fore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to-wards the people for their wrongdoings, yet 
[Page 100, Line 56] your Lord is severe in retribution.  
[Page 100, Line 57] 7. Those who disbelieve s ay, “Why was a mir-
[Page 100, Line 58] acle not sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and to every commu-
[Page 100, Line 59] nity is a guide.  
[Page 100, Line 60] 8. Allah knows what every female bears, and 
[Page 100, Line 61] every increase and decrease of the wombs. 
[Page 100, Line 62] With Him, everything is by measure.  
[Page 100, Line 63] 9. The Knower of  the Invisible and the Visible; 
[Page 100, Line 64] the Grand, the Supreme.  
[Page 100, Line 65] 10. It is the same; whether one of you conceals 
[Page 100, Line 66] his speech, or declares it; whether he goes into hiding by night, or goes out by day.  
[Page 100, Line 67] 11. He has a succession; before him and behind 
[Page 100, Line 68] him, protecting him  by Allah’s command. 
[Page 100, Line 69] Allah does not change the condition of a peo-
[Page 100, Line 70] ple until they change what is within them-
[Page 100, Line 71] selves. And if Allah wills any hardship for a 
[Page 100, Line 72] people, there is no turning it back; and apart 
[Page 100, Line 73] from Him they have no protector.  
[Page 100, Line 74] 12. It is He who shows y ou the lightening, 
[Page 100, Line 75] causing fear and hope. And He produces the heavy clouds.  
[Page 100, Line 76] 13. The thunder praises His glory, and so do 
[Page 100, Line 77] the angels, in awe of Him. And He sends the 
[Page 100, Line 78] thunderbolts, striking with them whomever 
[Page 100, Line 79] He wills. Yet they argue about Allah, while 
[Page 100, Line 80] He is  Tremendous in might.  
[Page 100, Line 81] 14. To Him belongs the call to truth. Those 
[Page 100, Line 82] they call upon besides Him do not respond to 
[Page 100, Line 83] them with anything —except as someone who 
[Page 100, Line 84] stretches his hands towards water, so that it 
[Page 100, Line 85] 89 
[Page 101, Line 1] 13.  THUNDER   (ar-Ra’d)  
[Page 101, Line 2] may reach his mouth, but it does not reach it. 
[Page 101, Line 3] The prayers  of the unbelievers are only in 
[Page 101, Line 4] vain.  
[Page 101, Line 5] 15. To Allah prostrates everyone in the heav-
[Page 101, Line 6] ens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows, in the morning and in the 
[Page 101, Line 7] evening.  
[Page 101, Line 8] 16. Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and 
[Page 101, Line 9] the earth?” Say, “Allah.” Sa y, “Have you taken 
[Page 101, Line 10] besides Him protectors, who have no power 
[Page 101, Line 11] to profit or harm even themselves?” Say, “Are 
[Page 101, Line 12] the blind and the seeing equal? Or are dark-
[Page 101, Line 13] ness and light equal? Or have they assigned to 
[Page 101, Line 14] Allah associates, who created the likes of His 
[Page 101, Line 15] creation, so  that the creations seemed to 
[Page 101, Line 16] them alike? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all 
[Page 101, Line 17] things, and He is The One, the Irresistible.”  
[Page 101, Line 18] 17. He sends down water from the sky, and riv-
[Page 101, Line 19] erbeds flow according to their capacity. The current carries swelling froth. And from what 
[Page 101, Line 20] they heat in fire of ornaments or utensils 
[Page 101, Line 21] comes a similar froth. Thus Allah exemplifies 
[Page 101, Line 22] truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it is 
[Page 101, Line 23] swept away, but what benefits the people re-
[Page 101, Line 24] mains in the ground. Thus Allah presents the 
[Page 101, Line 25] analogies.  
[Page 101, Line 26] 18. For those who respond to their Lord is the 
[Page 101, Line 27] best. But as for those who do not respond to 
[Page 101, Line 28] Him, even if they possessed everything on earth, and twice as much, they could not re-
[Page 101, Line 29] deem themselves with it. Those will have the 
[Page 101, Line 30] worst reckoning; and their home is Hell —a 
[Page 101, Line 31] miserable destination.  
[Page 101, Line 32] 19. Is he who knows that what was revealed to 
[Page 101, Line 33] your from your Lord is the truth, like him who is blind? Only those who reason will re-
[Page 101, Line 34] member.  
[Page 101, Line 35] 20. Those who fulfill the promise to Allah, and 
[Page 101, Line 36] do not violate the agreement.  
[Page 101, Line 37] 21. And those who join w hat Allah has com-
[Page 101, Line 38] manded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and 
[Page 101, Line 39] dread the dire reckoning.   
[Page 101, Line 40] 22. And those who patiently seek the presence 
[Page 101, Line 41] of their Lord, and pray regularly, and spend 
[Page 101, Line 42] from Our provisions to them, secretly and openly, and repel evil with good.  These will 
[Page 101, Line 43] have the Ultimate Home.  
[Page 101, Line 44] 23. Everlasting Gardens, which they will enter, 
[Page 101, Line 45] along with the righteous among their par-
[Page 101, Line 46] ents, and their spouses, and their descend-
[Page 101, Line 47] ants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate.  
[Page 101, Line 48] 24. “Peace be upon you, because  you endured 
[Page 101, Line 49] patiently. How excellent is the Final Home.”  
[Page 101, Line 50] 25. As for those who violate the promise to Al-
[Page 101, Line 51] lah, after pledging to keep it, and sever what 
[Page 101, Line 52] Allah has commanded to be joined, and 
[Page 101, Line 53] spread corruption on earth —these, the curse 
[Page 101, Line 54] will be upon them, and they will have the Worst Home.  
[Page 101, Line 55] 26. Allah dispenses the provisions to whom-
[Page 101, Line 56] ever He wills, and restricts. And they delight 
[Page 101, Line 57] in the worldly life; yet the worldly life, com-pared to the Hereafter, is only enjoyment.  
[Page 101, Line 58] 27. Those who disbelieve say, “If only a miracl e 
[Page 101, Line 59] was sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, 
[Page 101, Line 60] “Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and 
[Page 101, Line 61] He guides to Himself whoever repents.”  
[Page 101, Line 62] 28. Those who believe, and whose hearts find 
[Page 101, Line 63] comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely, 
[Page 101, Line 64] it is in the remembrance of Allah that h earts 
[Page 101, Line 65] find comfort.”  
[Page 101, Line 66] 29. For those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 101, Line 67] deeds —for them is happiness and a beautiful 
[Page 101, Line 68] return.  
[Page 101, Line 69] 30. Thus We sent you among a community be-
[Page 101, Line 70] fore which other communities have passed 
[Page 101, Line 71] away, that you may recite to them what We revealed to you.  Yet they deny the Benevolent 
[Page 101, Line 72] One. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god but He; in Him I trust, and to Him is my repent-
[Page 101, Line 73] ance.”  
[Page 101, Line 74] 31. Even if there were a Quran, by which 
[Page 101, Line 75] mountains could be set in motion, or by 
[Page 101, Line 76] which the earth could be shattered, or by which the dead could be made to speak. In 
[Page 101, Line 77] fact, every decision rests with Allah. Did the 
[Page 101, Line 78] believers not give up and realize that had Al-
[Page 101, Line 79] lah willed, He would have guided all human-
[Page 101, Line 80] ity? Disasters will continue to strike those 
[Page 101, Line 81] who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or  
[Page 101, Line 82] 90 
[Page 102, Line 1] 14.  ABRAHAM   (Ibrahim)  
[Page 102, Line 2] they fall near their homes, until Allah’s 
[Page 102, Line 3] promise comes true. Allah never breaks a 
[Page 102, Line 4] promise.  
[Page 102, Line 5] 32. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but 
[Page 102, Line 6] I granted the disbelievers respite, and then I 
[Page 102, Line 7] seized them. What a punishment it was!  
[Page 102, Line 8] 33. Is He who is watchful over the deeds of 
[Page 102, Line 9] every soul? Yet they ascribe associates to Al-
[Page 102, Line 10] lah. Say, “Name them! Or are you informing Him of something on earth He does not 
[Page 102, Line 11] know, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the 
[Page 102, Line 12] scheming of those who disbelieve is made to 
[Page 102, Line 13] appear good to them, and th ey are averted 
[Page 102, Line 14] from the path. Whomever Allah misguides 
[Page 102, Line 15] has no guide.  
[Page 102, Line 16] 34. There is for them torment in the worldly 
[Page 102, Line 17] life, but the torment of the Hereafter is 
[Page 102, Line 18] harsher. And they have no defender against 
[Page 102, Line 19] Allah.  
[Page 102, Line 20] 35. The likeness of the Garden promised to the 
[Page 102, Line 21] righteous: rivers flowing beneath it; its food 
[Page 102, Line 22] is perpetual, and so is its shade. Such is the 
[Page 102, Line 23] sequel for those who guard against evil, but 
[Page 102, Line 24] the sequel of the disbelievers is the Fire.  
[Page 102, Line 25] 36. Those to whom We gave the Scripture re-
[Page 102, Line 26] joice in what was revealed to you , while some 
[Page 102, Line 27] factions reject parts of it. Say, “I am com-
[Page 102, Line 28] manded to worship Allah, and to never asso-
[Page 102, Line 29] ciate anything with Him. To Him I invite, 
[Page 102, Line 30] and to Him is my return.”  
[Page 102, Line 31] 37. Thus We revealed it an Arabic code of law. 
[Page 102, Line 32] Were you to follow their desires, after the  
[Page 102, Line 33] knowledge that has come to you, you would have neither ally nor defender against Allah.  
[Page 102, Line 34] 38. We sent messengers before you, and We 
[Page 102, Line 35] assigned for them wives and offspring. No 
[Page 102, Line 36] messenger could bring a sign except with the 
[Page 102, Line 37] permission of Allah. For every era is a scrip-
[Page 102, Line 38] ture.  
[Page 102, Line 39] 39. Allah abolishes whatever He wills, and He 
[Page 102, Line 40] affirms. With Him is the source of the Scrip-
[Page 102, Line 41] ture.  
[Page 102, Line 42] 40. Whether We show you some of what We 
[Page 102, Line 43] have promised them, or We cause you to 
[Page 102, Line 44] die— your duty is to inform, and Ours is the 
[Page 102, Line 45] reckoning.  41. Do they n ot see how We deal with the 
[Page 102, Line 46] earth, diminishing it at its edges? Allah 
[Page 102, Line 47] judges; and nothing can hold back His judg-
[Page 102, Line 48] ment. And He is quick to settle accounts.  
[Page 102, Line 49] 42. Those before them planned, but the entire 
[Page 102, Line 50] plan is up to Allah. He knows what every soul 
[Page 102, Line 51] earns. Tho se who disbelieve will know to 
[Page 102, Line 52] whom the Ultimate Home is.  
[Page 102, Line 53] 43. Those who disbelieve say, “You are not a 
[Page 102, Line 54] messenger.” Say, “Allah is a sufficient witness 
[Page 102, Line 55] between me and you, and whoever has 
[Page 102, Line 56] knowledge of the Scripture.”  

[Page 102, Line 58] 14. ABRAHAM 
[Page 102, Line 59] (Ibrahim ) 
[Page 102, Line 60] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 102, Line 61] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 102, Line 62] 1. Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture that We revealed 
[Page 102, Line 63] to you, that you may bring humanity from 
[Page 102, Line 64] darkness to light —with the permission of 
[Page 102, Line 65] their Lord —to the path of the Almighty, the 
[Page 102, Line 66] Praiseworthy.  
[Page 102, Line 67] 2. Allah —to whom belongs what is in  the 
[Page 102, Line 68] heavens and the earth. And woe to the disbe-lievers from a severe torment.  
[Page 102, Line 69] 3. Those who prefer the present life to the 
[Page 102, Line 70] Hereafter, and repel from the path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked —these are far 
[Page 102, Line 71] astray.  
[Page 102, Line 72] 4. We never sent any messenger except in the 
[Page 102, Line 73] language of his people, to make things clear for them. Allah leads astray whom He wills, 
[Page 102, Line 74] and guides whom He wills. He is the Mighty, 
[Page 102, Line 75] the Wise.  
[Page 102, Line 76] 5. We sent Moses with Our signs: “Bring your 
[Page 102, Line 77] people out of darkness into light, and remind 
[Page 102, Line 78] them of the Day s of Allah.” In that are signs 
[Page 102, Line 79] for every patient and thankful person.”  
[Page 102, Line 80] 6. Moses said to his people, “Remember Al-
[Page 102, Line 81] lah’s blessings upon you, as He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who inflicted on 
[Page 102, Line 82] you terrible suffering, slaughtering your sons 
[Page 102, Line 83] while sparing your daughters. In that was a 
[Page 102, Line 84] serious trial from your Lord.”  
[Page 102, Line 85] 91 
[Page 103, Line 1] 14.  ABRAHAM   (Ibrahim)  
[Page 103, Line 2] 7. And when your Lord proclaimed: “If you 
[Page 103, Line 3] give thanks, I will grant you increase; but if 
[Page 103, Line 4] you are ungrateful, My punishment is se-
[Page 103, Line 5] vere.”  
[Page 103, Line 6] 8. And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrate-
[Page 103, Line 7] ful, toge ther with everyone on earth —Allah is 
[Page 103, Line 8] in no need, Worthy of Praise.”  
[Page 103, Line 9] 9. Has not the story reached you, of those be-
[Page 103, Line 10] fore you, the people of Noah, and Aad, and 
[Page 103, Line 11] Thamood —and those after them? None 
[Page 103, Line 12] knows them except Allah. Their messengers 
[Page 103, Line 13] came to them with the c lear proofs, but they 
[Page 103, Line 14] tried to silence them, and said, “We reject 
[Page 103, Line 15] what you are sent with, and we are in serious 
[Page 103, Line 16] doubt regarding what you are calling us to.”  
[Page 103, Line 17] 10. Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt 
[Page 103, Line 18] about Allah, Maker of the heavens and the 
[Page 103, Line 19] earth? He calls you to forgive you your sins, 
[Page 103, Line 20] and to defer you until a stated term.” They 
[Page 103, Line 21] said, “You are only humans like us; you want 
[Page 103, Line 22] to turn us away from what our ancestors wor-
[Page 103, Line 23] shiped; so bring us a clear proof.”  
[Page 103, Line 24] 11. Their messengers said to them, “We are 
[Page 103, Line 25] only huma ns like you, but Allah favors 
[Page 103, Line 26] whomever He wills from among His servants. 
[Page 103, Line 27] We cannot possibly show you any proof, ex-
[Page 103, Line 28] cept by leave of Allah. In Allah let the faithful 
[Page 103, Line 29] put their trust.”  
[Page 103, Line 30] 12. “And why should we not trust in Allah, 
[Page 103, Line 31] when He has guided us in our ways? We will 
[Page 103, Line 32] persevere in the face of your persecution. 
[Page 103, Line 33] And upon Allah the reliant should rely.”  
[Page 103, Line 34] 13. Those who disbelieved said to their mes-
[Page 103, Line 35] sengers, “We will expel you from our land, 
[Page 103, Line 36] unless you return to our religion.” And their 
[Page 103, Line 37] Lord inspired them: “We will  destroy the 
[Page 103, Line 38] wrongdoers.”  
[Page 103, Line 39] 14. “And We will settle you in the land after 
[Page 103, Line 40] them. That is for him who fears My Majesty, 
[Page 103, Line 41] and fears My threats.”  
[Page 103, Line 42] 15. And they prayed for victory, and every 
[Page 103, Line 43] stubborn tyrant came to disappointment.  
[Page 103, Line 44] 16. Beyond him lies Hell, and he w ill be given 
[Page 103, Line 45] to drink putrid water.  17. He will guzzle it, but he will not swallow it. 
[Page 103, Line 46] Death will come at him from every direction, 
[Page 103, Line 47] but he will not die. And beyond this is relent-
[Page 103, Line 48] less suffering.  
[Page 103, Line 49] 18. The likeness of those who disbelieve in 
[Page 103, Line 50] their Lord: their works are like ashes, in a 
[Page 103, Line 51] fierce wind, on a stormy day. They have no 
[Page 103, Line 52] control over anything they have earned. That 
[Page 103, Line 53] is the utmost misguidance.  
[Page 103, Line 54] 19. Do you not see that Allah created the heav-
[Page 103, Line 55] ens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He 
[Page 103, Line 56] can do away with you, and bring a new crea-
[Page 103, Line 57] tion.  
[Page 103, Line 58] 20. And that is not difficult for Allah.  
[Page 103, Line 59] 21. They will emerge before Allah, altogether. 
[Page 103, Line 60] The weak will say to those who were proud, “We were your followers, can you protect us at all against Allah’s punishment?” They will 
[Page 103, Line 61] say, “Had  Allah guided us, we would have 
[Page 103, Line 62] guided you. It is the same for us; whether we 
[Page 103, Line 63] mourn, or are patient; there is no asylum for 
[Page 103, Line 64] us.” 
[Page 103, Line 65] 22. And Satan will say, when the issue is set-
[Page 103, Line 66] tled, “Allah has promised you the promise of 
[Page 103, Line 67] truth, and I promised you, but I fail ed you. I 
[Page 103, Line 68] had no authority over you, except that I called 
[Page 103, Line 69] you, and you answered me. So do not blame 
[Page 103, Line 70] me, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to 
[Page 103, Line 71] your aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject 
[Page 103, Line 72] your associating with me in the past. The 
[Page 103, Line 73] wrongdoers will have a t orment most pain-
[Page 103, Line 74] ful.”  
[Page 103, Line 75] 23. But those who believed and did good deeds 
[Page 103, Line 76] will be admitted into gardens beneath which 
[Page 103, Line 77] rivers flow, to remain therein forever, by 
[Page 103, Line 78] leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will 
[Page 103, Line 79] be: “Peace.”  
[Page 103, Line 80] 24. Do you not see how Allah presents a para-
[Page 103, Line 81] ble? A good word is like a good tree —its root 
[Page 103, Line 82] is firm, and its branches are in the sky.  
[Page 103, Line 83] 25. It yields its fruits every season by the will of 
[Page 103, Line 84] its Lord. Allah presents the parables to the people, so that they may reflect.  
[Page 103, Line 85] 26. And the parable of a bad word is that of a 
[Page 103, Line 86] bad tree —it is uprooted from the ground; it 
[Page 103, Line 87] has no stability.  
[Page 103, Line 88] 92 
[Page 104, Line 1] 14.  ABRAHAM   (Ibrahim)  
[Page 104, Line 2] 27. Allah gives firmness to those who believe, 
[Page 104, Line 3] with the firm word, in this life, and in the 
[Page 104, Line 4] Hereafter. And Allah leads the wicked astray. 
[Page 104, Line 5] Allah does whatever He wills.  
[Page 104, Line 6] 28. Have  you not seen those who exchanged 
[Page 104, Line 7] the blessing of Allah with blasphemy, and 
[Page 104, Line 8] landed their people into the house of perdi-
[Page 104, Line 9] tion?  
[Page 104, Line 10] 29. Hell—they will roast in it. What a misera-
[Page 104, Line 11] ble settlement.  
[Page 104, Line 12] 30. And they set up rivals to Allah, in order to 
[Page 104, Line 13] lead away from His path. Say, “Enjoy your-selves; your destination is the Fire.”  
[Page 104, Line 14] 31. Tell My servants who have believed to per-
[Page 104, Line 15] form the prayers, and to give from what We 
[Page 104, Line 16] have given them, secretly and publicly, before 
[Page 104, Line 17] a Day comes in which there is neither trading 
[Page 104, Line 18] nor friendship.  
[Page 104, Line 19] 32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and 
[Page 104, Line 20] the earth, and sends down water from the 
[Page 104, Line 21] sky, and with it produces fruits for your sus-tenance. And He committed the ships to your 
[Page 104, Line 22] service, sailing through the sea by His com-
[Page 104, Line 23] mand, and He committed the rivers to yo ur 
[Page 104, Line 24] service.  
[Page 104, Line 25] 33. And He committed the sun and the moon 
[Page 104, Line 26] to your service, both continuously pursuing their courses, and He committed the night 
[Page 104, Line 27] and the day to your service.  
[Page 104, Line 28] 34. And He has given you something of all 
[Page 104, Line 29] what you asked. And if you were to count Al-
[Page 104, Line 30] lah’s blessings, you would not be able to enu-
[Page 104, Line 31] merate them. The human being is unfair and 
[Page 104, Line 32] ungrateful.  
[Page 104, Line 33] 35. Recall that Abraham said, “O my Lord, 
[Page 104, Line 34] make this land peaceful, and keep me and my 
[Page 104, Line 35] sons from worshiping idols.”  
[Page 104, Line 36] 36. “My Lord, they have led many people 
[Page 104, Line 37] astray. Whoever follows me belongs with me; 
[Page 104, Line 38] and whoever disobeys me —You are Forgiv-
[Page 104, Line 39] ing and Merciful.  
[Page 104, Line 40] 37. “Our Lord, I have settled some of my off-
[Page 104, Line 41] spring in a valley of no vegetation, by Your 
[Page 104, Line 42] Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may perform the prayers. So make the hearts of some people incline towards them, and pro-
[Page 104, Line 43] vide them with fruits, that they may be thank-
[Page 104, Line 44] ful.”  
[Page 104, Line 45] 38. “Our Lord, You know what we conceal and 
[Page 104, Line 46] what we reveal. And nothing is hidden from 
[Page 104, Line 47] Allah, on earth or in the heaven.”  
[Page 104, Line 48] 39. “Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in 
[Page 104, Line 49] my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the 
[Page 104, Line 50] Hearer of Prayers.”  
[Page 104, Line 51] 40. “My Lord, make me one who performs the 
[Page 104, Line 52] prayer, and from my offspring. Our Lord, ac-
[Page 104, Line 53] cept my supplication.”  
[Page 104, Line 54] 41. “Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents, 
[Page 104, Line 55] and the believers, o n the Day the Reckoning 
[Page 104, Line 56] takes place.”  
[Page 104, Line 57] 42. Do not ever think that Allah is unaware of 
[Page 104, Line 58] what the wrongdoers do. He only defers them 
[Page 104, Line 59] until a Day when the sights stare.  
[Page 104, Line 60] 43. Their necks outstretched, their heads up-
[Page 104, Line 61] raised, their gaze unblinking, their hearts 
[Page 104, Line 62] void . 
[Page 104, Line 63] 44. And warn mankind of the Day when the 
[Page 104, Line 64] punishment will come upon them, and the wicked will say, “Our Lord, defer us for a little 
[Page 104, Line 65] while, and we will answer Your call and fol-
[Page 104, Line 66] low the messengers.” Did you not swear be-
[Page 104, Line 67] fore that there will be no passing away  for 
[Page 104, Line 68] you?  
[Page 104, Line 69] 45. And you inhabited the homes of those who 
[Page 104, Line 70] wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We cited 
[Page 104, Line 71] for you the examples.  
[Page 104, Line 72] 46. They planned their plans, but their plans 
[Page 104, Line 73] are known to Allah, even if their plans can 
[Page 104, Line 74] elimi nate mountains.  
[Page 104, Line 75] 47. Do not ever think that Allah will break His 
[Page 104, Line 76] promise to His messengers. Allah is Strong, 
[Page 104, Line 77] Able to Avenge.  
[Page 104, Line 78] 48. On the Day when the earth is changed into 
[Page 104, Line 79] another earth, and the heavens, and they will 
[Page 104, Line 80] emerge before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.  
[Page 104, Line 81] 49. On that Day, you will see the sinners bound 
[Page 104, Line 82] together in chains.  
[Page 104, Line 83] 93 
[Page 105, Line 1] 15.  THE ROCK   (al-Hijr)  
[Page 105, Line 2] 50. Their garments made of tar, and the Fire 
[Page 105, Line 3] covering their faces.  
[Page 105, Line 4] 51. That Allah may repay each soul according 
[Page 105, Line 5] to what it has earned. Allah is Quick in reck-
[Page 105, Line 6] oning.  
[Page 105, Line 7] 52. This is a proclamation for mankind, that 
[Page 105, Line 8] they may be warned thereby, and know that 
[Page 105, Line 9] He is One God, and that people of under-
[Page 105, Line 10] standing may remember.  

[Page 105, Line 12] 15. THE ROCK  
[Page 105, Line 13] (al-Hijr) 
[Page 105, Line 14] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 105, Line 15] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 105, Line 16] 1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the 
[Page 105, Line 17] Book; a Quran that makes things clear.  
[Page 105, Line 18] 2. Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to 
[Page 105, Line 19] become Muslims.  
[Page 105, Line 20] 3. Leave them to eat, and enjoy, and be lulled 
[Page 105, Line 21] by hope. They will find out.  
[Page 105, Line 22] 4. We have never destroyed a town unless it 
[Page 105, Line 23] had a set time.  
[Page 105, Line 24] 5. No nation can b ring its time forward, nor 
[Page 105, Line 25] can they delay it.  
[Page 105, Line 26] 6. And they said, “O you who received the 
[Page 105, Line 27] message, you are insane.”  
[Page 105, Line 28] 7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you 
[Page 105, Line 29] are truthful?”  
[Page 105, Line 30] 8. We do not send the angels down except 
[Page 105, Line 31] with reason, and they will not be held b ack. 
[Page 105, Line 32] 9. Surely We revealed the Message, and We 
[Page 105, Line 33] will surely preserve it.  
[Page 105, Line 34] 10. We sent others before you, to the former 
[Page 105, Line 35] communities.  
[Page 105, Line 36] 11. But no messenger came to them, but they 
[Page 105, Line 37] ridiculed him.  
[Page 105, Line 38] 12. Thus We slip it into the hearts of the guilty.  
[Page 105, Line 39] 13. They do not believe in it, though the ways 
[Page 105, Line 40] of the ancients have passed away.  
[Page 105, Line 41] 14. Even if We opened for them a gateway into 
[Page 105, Line 42] the sky, and they began to ascend through it.  15. They would still say, “Our eyes are halluci-
[Page 105, Line 43] nating; in fact, we are people bewitched.”  
[Page 105, Line 44] 16. We p laced constellations in the sky, and 
[Page 105, Line 45] made them beautiful to the beholders.  
[Page 105, Line 46] 17. And We guarded them from every outcast 
[Page 105, Line 47] devil.  
[Page 105, Line 48] 18. Except one who steals a hearing, and is fol-
[Page 105, Line 49] lowed by a visible projectile.  
[Page 105, Line 50] 19. We spread the earth, and placed stabilizers 
[Page 105, Line 51] in it, and in it We grew all things in proper 
[Page 105, Line 52] measure.  
[Page 105, Line 53] 20. And in it We created livelihoods for you, 
[Page 105, Line 54] and for those for whom you are not the pro-
[Page 105, Line 55] viders.  
[Page 105, Line 56] 21. There is not a thing but with Us are its 
[Page 105, Line 57] stores, and We send it down only in precise 
[Page 105, Line 58] measure.  
[Page 105, Line 59] 22. We send the fertilizing winds; and send 
[Page 105, Line 60] down water from the sky, and give it to you 
[Page 105, Line 61] to drink, and you are not the ones who store 
[Page 105, Line 62] it. 
[Page 105, Line 63] 23. It is We who give life and cause death, and 
[Page 105, Line 64] We are the Inheritors.  
[Page 105, Line 65] 24. And We know those of you who go for-
[Page 105, Line 66] ward, and We know those who lag behind.  
[Page 105, Line 67] 25. It is your Lord who will gather them to-
[Page 105, Line 68] gether. He is the Wise, the Knowing.  
[Page 105, Line 69] 26. We created the human being from clay, 
[Page 105, Line 70] from molded mud.  
[Page 105, Line 71] 27. And the jinn We created before, from 
[Page 105, Line 72] piercing fire.  
[Page 105, Line 73] 28. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am  creating 
[Page 105, Line 74] a human being from clay, from molded 
[Page 105, Line 75] mud.”  
[Page 105, Line 76] 29. “When I have formed him, and breathed 
[Page 105, Line 77] into him of My spirit, fall down prostrating 
[Page 105, Line 78] before him.”  
[Page 105, Line 79] 30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all to-
[Page 105, Line 80] gether.  
[Page 105, Line 81] 31. Except for Satan. He refused to be among 
[Page 105, Line 82] those who prostrated themselves.  
[Page 105, Line 83] 94 
[Page 106, Line 1] 15.  THE ROCK   (al-Hijr)  
[Page 106, Line 2] 32. He said, “O Satan, what kept you from be-
[Page 106, Line 3] ing among those who prostrated them-
[Page 106, Line 4] selves?”  
[Page 106, Line 5] 33. He said, “I am not about to prostrate my-
[Page 106, Line 6] self before a human being, whom You created 
[Page 106, Line 7] from clay, from molded mud.”  
[Page 106, Line 8] 34. He said, “Then ge t out of here, for you are 
[Page 106, Line 9] an outcast”.  
[Page 106, Line 10] 35. “And the curse will be upon you until the 
[Page 106, Line 11] Day of Judgment.”  
[Page 106, Line 12] 36. He said, “My Lord, reprieve me until the 
[Page 106, Line 13] Day they are resurrected.”  
[Page 106, Line 14] 37. He said, “You are of those reprieved.”  
[Page 106, Line 15] 38. “Until the Day of the time appoin ted.”  
[Page 106, Line 16] 39. He said, “My Lord, since You have lured 
[Page 106, Line 17] me away, I will glamorize for them on earth, 
[Page 106, Line 18] and I will lure them all away.”  
[Page 106, Line 19] 40. “Except for Your sincere servants among 
[Page 106, Line 20] them.”  
[Page 106, Line 21] 41. He said, “This is a right way with Me.”  
[Page 106, Line 22] 42. “Over My servants you have no authority, 
[Page 106, Line 23] except for the sinners who follow you.”  
[Page 106, Line 24] 43. And Hell is the meeting -place for them all.  
[Page 106, Line 25] 44. “It has seven doors; for each door is an as-
[Page 106, Line 26] signed class.”  
[Page 106, Line 27] 45. But the righteous will be in gardens with 
[Page 106, Line 28] springs.  
[Page 106, Line 29] 46. “Enter it in peace and security.”  
[Page 106, Line 30] 47. And We will remove all ill -feelings from 
[Page 106, Line 31] their hearts —brothers and sisters, on 
[Page 106, Line 32] couches facing one another.  
[Page 106, Line 33] 48. No fatigue will ever touch them therein, 
[Page 106, Line 34] nor will they be asked to leave it.  
[Page 106, Line 35] 49. Inform My servants that I am the Forgiver, 
[Page 106, Line 36] the Merciful.  
[Page 106, Line 37] 50. And that My punishment is the painful 
[Page 106, Line 38] punishment.  
[Page 106, Line 39] 51. And inform them of the guests of Abra-
[Page 106, Line 40] ham.  
[Page 106, Line 41] 52. When they entered upon him, and said, 
[Page 106, Line 42] “Peace.” He said, “We are wary of you.”  53. They said, “Do not fear; we bring you good 
[Page 106, Line 43] news of a boy endowed with knowledge.”  
[Page 106, Line 44] 54. He said, “Do you bring me good news, 
[Page 106, Line 45] when old age has overtaken me? What good news do you bring?”  
[Page 106, Line 46] 55. They said, “We bring you good news in 
[Page 106, Line 47] truth, so do not despair.”  
[Page 106, Line 48] 56. He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s 
[Page 106, Line 49] mercy but the lost?”  
[Page 106, Line 50] 57. He said, “So what is your business, O en-
[Page 106, Line 51] voys?”  
[Page 106, Line 52] 58. They said, “We were sent to a sinful peo-
[Page 106, Line 53] ple.”  
[Page 106, Line 54] 59. “Except for the family of Lot; we will save 
[Page 106, Line 55] them all.”  
[Page 106, Line 56] 60. “Except for his wife.” We have determined 
[Page 106, Line 57] that she will be of those who lag behind.  
[Page 106, Line 58] 61. And when th e envoys came to the family of 
[Page 106, Line 59] Lot. 
[Page 106, Line 60] 62. He said, “You are a people unknown to 
[Page 106, Line 61] me.”  
[Page 106, Line 62] 63. They said, “We bring you what they have 
[Page 106, Line 63] doubts about.”  
[Page 106, Line 64] 64. “We bring you the truth, and we are truth-
[Page 106, Line 65] ful.”  
[Page 106, Line 66] 65. “Travel with your family at the dead of the 
[Page 106, Line 67] night, and foll ow up behind them, and let 
[Page 106, Line 68] none of you look back, and proceed as com-manded.”  
[Page 106, Line 69] 66. And We informed him of Our decree: the 
[Page 106, Line 70] last remnant of these will be uprooted by early morning.  
[Page 106, Line 71] 67. And the people of the town came joyfully.  
[Page 106, Line 72] 68. He said, “These are my guests , so do not 
[Page 106, Line 73] embarrass me.”  
[Page 106, Line 74] 69. “And fear Allah, and do not disgrace me.”  
[Page 106, Line 75] 70. They said, “Did we not forbid you from 
[Page 106, Line 76] strangers?”  
[Page 106, Line 77] 71. He said, “These are my daughters, if you 
[Page 106, Line 78] must.”  
[Page 106, Line 79] 72. By your life, they were blundering in their 
[Page 106, Line 80] drunkenness.  
[Page 106, Line 81] 95 
[Page 107, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 107, Line 2] 73. So the Blas t struck them at sunrise.  
[Page 107, Line 3] 74. And We turned it upside down, and rained 
[Page 107, Line 4] down upon them stones of baked clay.  
[Page 107, Line 5] 75. Surely in that are lessons for those who 
[Page 107, Line 6] read signs.  
[Page 107, Line 7] 76. And it is on an existing road.  
[Page 107, Line 8] 77. Surely in that is a sign for the believers.  
[Page 107, Line 9] 78. The people of the Woods were also wrong-
[Page 107, Line 10] doers.  
[Page 107, Line 11] 79. So We took revenge upon them. Both are 
[Page 107, Line 12] clearly documented.  
[Page 107, Line 13] 80. The people of the Rock also rejected the 
[Page 107, Line 14] messengers.  
[Page 107, Line 15] 81. We gave them Our revelations, but they 
[Page 107, Line 16] turned away from them.  
[Page 107, Line 17] 82. They used to carve homes  in the moun-
[Page 107, Line 18] tains, feeling secure.  
[Page 107, Line 19] 83. But the Blast struck them in the morning.  
[Page 107, Line 20] 84. All they had acquired was of no avail to 
[Page 107, Line 21] them.  
[Page 107, Line 22] 85. We did not create the heavens and the 
[Page 107, Line 23] earth, and what lies between them, except 
[Page 107, Line 24] with truth. The Hour is coming, so forg ive 
[Page 107, Line 25] with gracious forgiveness.  
[Page 107, Line 26] 86. Your Lord is the All -Knowing Creator.  
[Page 107, Line 27] 87. We have given you seven of the pairs, and 
[Page 107, Line 28] the Grand Quran.  
[Page 107, Line 29] 88. Do not extend your eyes towards what We 
[Page 107, Line 30] have bestowed on some couples of them to 
[Page 107, Line 31] enjoy, and do not grieve over them,  and lower 
[Page 107, Line 32] your wing to the believers.  
[Page 107, Line 33] 89. And say, “I am the clear warner.”  
[Page 107, Line 34] 90. Just as We sent down to the separatists.  
[Page 107, Line 35] 91. Those who made the Quran obsolete.  
[Page 107, Line 36] 92. By your Lord, we will question them all.  
[Page 107, Line 37] 93. About what they used to do.  
[Page 107, Line 38] 94. So proclaim op enly what you are com-
[Page 107, Line 39] manded, and turn away from the polytheists.  
[Page 107, Line 40] 95. We are enough for you against the mock-
[Page 107, Line 41] ers. 96. Those who set up another god with Allah. 
[Page 107, Line 42] They will come to know.  
[Page 107, Line 43] 97. We are aware that your heart is strained by 
[Page 107, Line 44] what they say.  
[Page 107, Line 45] 98. So glori fy the praise of your Lord, and be 
[Page 107, Line 46] among those who bow down.  
[Page 107, Line 47] 99. And worship your Lord in order to attain 
[Page 107, Line 48] certainty.  

[Page 107, Line 50] 16. THE BEE  
[Page 107, Line 51] (an-Nahl ) 
[Page 107, Line 52] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 107, Line 53] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 107, Line 54] 1. The command of Allah has come, so do not 
[Page 107, Line 55] rush it. Glory be to H im; exalted above what 
[Page 107, Line 56] they associate.  
[Page 107, Line 57] 2. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by 
[Page 107, Line 58] His command, upon whom He wills of His 
[Page 107, Line 59] servants: “Give warning that there is no god 
[Page 107, Line 60] but Me, and fear Me.”  
[Page 107, Line 61] 3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
[Page 107, Line 62] justice. He is exalted above the associations 
[Page 107, Line 63] they attribute.  
[Page 107, Line 64] 4. He created the human being from a drop of 
[Page 107, Line 65] fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.  
[Page 107, Line 66] 5. And the livestock —He created them for 
[Page 107, Line 67] you. In them are warmth and benefits for you, and of them you eat.  
[Page 107, Line 68] 6. And there is  beauty in them for you, when 
[Page 107, Line 69] you bring them home, and when you drive 
[Page 107, Line 70] them to pasture.  
[Page 107, Line 71] 7. And they carry your loads to territory you 
[Page 107, Line 72] could not have reached without great hard-
[Page 107, Line 73] ship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.  
[Page 107, Line 74] 8. And the horses, and the mules, and the  don-
[Page 107, Line 75] keys —for you to ride, and for luxury. And He 
[Page 107, Line 76] creates what you do not know.  
[Page 107, Line 77] 9. It is for Allah to point out the paths, but 
[Page 107, Line 78] some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He 
[Page 107, Line 79] could have guided you all.  
[Page 107, Line 80] 96 
[Page 108, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 108, Line 2] 10. It is He Who sends down for you from the 
[Page 108, Line 3] sky water. From  it is drink, and with it grows 
[Page 108, Line 4] vegetation for grazing.  
[Page 108, Line 5] 11. And He produces for you grains with it, 
[Page 108, Line 6] and olives, and date -palms, and grapes, and 
[Page 108, Line 7] all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for 
[Page 108, Line 8] people who think.  
[Page 108, Line 9] 12. And He regulated for you the night and the 
[Page 108, Line 10] day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars 
[Page 108, Line 11] are disposed by His command. Surely in that 
[Page 108, Line 12] are signs for people who ponder.  
[Page 108, Line 13] 13. And whatsoever He created for you on 
[Page 108, Line 14] earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a 
[Page 108, Line 15] sign for people who are mindful.  
[Page 108, Line 16] 14. And  it is He who made the sea to serve you, 
[Page 108, Line 17] that you may eat from it tender meat, and ex-
[Page 108, Line 18] tract from it ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships plowing through it, as you 
[Page 108, Line 19] seek His bounties, so that you may give 
[Page 108, Line 20] thanks.  
[Page 108, Line 21] 15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it 
[Page 108, Line 22] shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that 
[Page 108, Line 23] you may be guided.  
[Page 108, Line 24] 16. And landmarks. And by the stars they 
[Page 108, Line 25] guide themselves.  
[Page 108, Line 26] 17. Is He who creates like him who does not 
[Page 108, Line 27] create? Will you not take a lesson?  
[Page 108, Line 28] 18. And if you tried to enumerate the  favors of 
[Page 108, Line 29] Allah, you will not be able to count them. Al-
[Page 108, Line 30] lah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 108, Line 31] 19. And Allah knows what you hide and what 
[Page 108, Line 32] you disclose.  
[Page 108, Line 33] 20. Those they invoke besides Allah create 
[Page 108, Line 34] nothing, but are themselves created.  
[Page 108, Line 35] 21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not 
[Page 108, Line 36] know when they will be resurrected.  
[Page 108, Line 37] 22. Your God is one God. As for those who do 
[Page 108, Line 38] not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are 
[Page 108, Line 39] in denial, and they are arrogant.  
[Page 108, Line 40] 23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they 
[Page 108, Line 41] conceal and what they reveal. He does  not 
[Page 108, Line 42] like the arrogant.  24. And when it is said to them, “What has 
[Page 108, Line 43] your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of 
[Page 108, Line 44] the ancients.”  
[Page 108, Line 45] 25. So let them carry their loads complete on 
[Page 108, Line 46] the Day of Resurrection, and some of the 
[Page 108, Line 47] loads of those they misguided without 
[Page 108, Line 48] knowl edge. Evil is what they carry.  
[Page 108, Line 49] 26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah 
[Page 108, Line 50] took their structures from the foundations, 
[Page 108, Line 51] and the roof caved in on them. The punish-
[Page 108, Line 52] ment came at them from where they did not 
[Page 108, Line 53] perceive.  
[Page 108, Line 54] 27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He w ill 
[Page 108, Line 55] disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso-
[Page 108, Line 56] ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?” 
[Page 108, Line 57] Those who were given knowledge will say, 
[Page 108, Line 58] “Today shame and misery are upon the dis-
[Page 108, Line 59] believers.”  
[Page 108, Line 60] 28. Those wronging their souls while the an-
[Page 108, Line 61] gels are taking them away —they  will propose 
[Page 108, Line 62] peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah is aware of what you used to do.”  
[Page 108, Line 63] 29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for-
[Page 108, Line 64] ever. Miserable is the residence of the arro-
[Page 108, Line 65] gant.  
[Page 108, Line 66] 30. And it will be said to those who maintained 
[Page 108, Line 67] piety, “What has  your Lord revealed?” They 
[Page 108, Line 68] will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good 
[Page 108, Line 69] in this world is goodness, and the Home of 
[Page 108, Line 70] the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful 
[Page 108, Line 71] is the residence of the pious.  
[Page 108, Line 72] 31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will 
[Page 108, Line 73] enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they 
[Page 108, Line 74] will have whatever they desire. Thus Allah re-
[Page 108, Line 75] wards the pious.  
[Page 108, Line 76] 32. Those who are in a wholesome state when 
[Page 108, Line 77] the angels take them —will say, “Peace be 
[Page 108, Line 78] upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used to do.”  
[Page 108, Line 79] 33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come 
[Page 108, Line 80] to them, or for the command of your Lord to 
[Page 108, Line 81] arrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah 
[Page 108, Line 82] did not wrong them, but they used to wrong 
[Page 108, Line 83] their own souls.  
[Page 108, Line 84] 97 
[Page 109, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 109, Line 2] 34. So the evils of their deeds assailed them, 
[Page 109, Line 3] and what they used to ridicule engulfed them . 
[Page 109, Line 4] 35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we 
[Page 109, Line 5] would not have worshiped anything besides 
[Page 109, Line 6] Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor 
[Page 109, Line 7] would we have prohibited anything besides 
[Page 109, Line 8] His prohibitions.” Those before them did 
[Page 109, Line 9] likewise. Are the messengers responsible for  
[Page 109, Line 10] anything but clear communication?  
[Page 109, Line 11] 36. To every community We sent a messenger: 
[Page 109, Line 12] “Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of them Allah guided, while others deserved misguidance. So travel through the earth, and 
[Page 109, Line 13] see what the fate of the deniers was.  
[Page 109, Line 14] 37. Even though you may be concerned about 
[Page 109, Line 15] their guidance, Allah does not guide those 
[Page 109, Line 16] who misguide. And they will have no saviors.  
[Page 109, Line 17] 38. And they swear by Allah with their most 
[Page 109, Line 18] solemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any-
[Page 109, Line 19] one who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise binding on Him, but most people do not 
[Page 109, Line 20] know.  
[Page 109, Line 21] 39. To clarify for them what they differed 
[Page 109, Line 22] about, and for the faithless to know that they 
[Page 109, Line 23] were liars.  
[Page 109, Line 24] 40. When We intend for something to happen, 
[Page 109, Line 25] We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.  
[Page 109, Line 26] 41. Those who emigrate for Alla h’s sake after 
[Page 109, Line 27] being persecuted, We will settle them in a 
[Page 109, Line 28] good place in this world; but the reward of 
[Page 109, Line 29] the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.  
[Page 109, Line 30] 42. Those who endure patiently, and in their 
[Page 109, Line 31] Lord they put their trust.  
[Page 109, Line 32] 43. We did not send before you except  men 
[Page 109, Line 33] whom We inspired. So ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.  
[Page 109, Line 34] 44. With the clarifications and the scriptures. 
[Page 109, Line 35] And We revealed to you the Reminder, that you may clarify to the people what was re-
[Page 109, Line 36] vealed to them, and that they may reflect.  
[Page 109, Line 37] 45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that 
[Page 109, Line 38] Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with 
[Page 109, Line 39] them, or that the punishment will not come 
[Page 109, Line 40] upon them from where they do not perceive?  46. Or that He will not seize them during their 
[Page 109, Line 41] activities? And they will not be ab le to pre-
[Page 109, Line 42] vent it.  
[Page 109, Line 43] 47. Or that He will not seize them while in 
[Page 109, Line 44] dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.  
[Page 109, Line 45] 48. Have they not observed what Allah has cre-
[Page 109, Line 46] ated? Their shadows revolve from the right 
[Page 109, Line 47] and the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink 
[Page 109, Line 48] away.  
[Page 109, Line 49] 49. To Allah b ows down everything in the 
[Page 109, Line 50] heavens and everything on earth —every liv-
[Page 109, Line 51] ing creature, and the angels, and without be-ing proud.  
[Page 109, Line 52] 50. They fear their Lord above them, and they 
[Page 109, Line 53] do what they are commanded.  
[Page 109, Line 54] 51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He 
[Page 109, Line 55] is only One G od; so fear only Me.”  
[Page 109, Line 56] 52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
[Page 109, Line 57] and the earth; and to Him obedience is due 
[Page 109, Line 58] always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than 
[Page 109, Line 59] Allah?  
[Page 109, Line 60] 53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah. 
[Page 109, Line 61] And when harm touches you, it is to Him that 
[Page 109, Line 62] you groan.  
[Page 109, Line 63] 54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some 
[Page 109, Line 64] of you associate others with their Lord.  
[Page 109, Line 65] 55. To show ingratitude for what We have 
[Page 109, Line 66] given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon know.  
[Page 109, Line 67] 56. And they allocate, to something they do 
[Page 109, Line 68] not know, a share of what We have provided 
[Page 109, Line 69] for them. By Allah, you will be questioned 
[Page 109, Line 70] about what you have been inventing.  
[Page 109, Line 71] 57. And they attribute to Allah daughters —ex-
[Page 109, Line 72] alted is He —and for themselves what they de-
[Page 109, Line 73] sire. 
[Page 109, Line 74] 58. And when one of them is given news of a 
[Page 109, Line 75] female infant, his face  darkens, and he chokes 
[Page 109, Line 76] with grief.  
[Page 109, Line 77] 59. He hides from the people because of the 
[Page 109, Line 78] bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in hu-
[Page 109, Line 79] miliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the 
[Page 109, Line 80] decision they make.  
[Page 109, Line 81] 98 
[Page 110, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 110, Line 2] 60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
[Page 110, Line 3] set a bad example,  while Allah sets the High-
[Page 110, Line 4] est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.  
[Page 110, Line 5] 61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in-
[Page 110, Line 6] justices, He would not leave upon it a single 
[Page 110, Line 7] creature, but He postpones them until an ap-
[Page 110, Line 8] pointed time. Then, when their time arrives, 
[Page 110, Line 9] they will  not delay it by one hour, nor will 
[Page 110, Line 10] they advance it.  
[Page 110, Line 11] 62. And they attribute to Allah what they 
[Page 110, Line 12] themselves dislike, while their tongues utter the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be 
[Page 110, Line 13] neglected.  
[Page 110, Line 14] 63. By Alla h, We sent messengers to commu-
[Page 110, Line 15] nities before you, but Satan made their deeds appear alluring to them. He is their master 
[Page 110, Line 16] today, and they will have a painful punish-
[Page 110, Line 17] ment.  
[Page 110, Line 18] 64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to 
[Page 110, Line 19] clarify for them what they differ about, an d 
[Page 110, Line 20] guidance and mercy for people who believe.  
[Page 110, Line 21] 65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with 
[Page 110, Line 22] which He revives the earth after its death. In 
[Page 110, Line 23] this is a sign for people who listen.  
[Page 110, Line 24] 66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We 
[Page 110, Line 25] give you a drink from their bell ies, from be-
[Page 110, Line 26] tween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing to the drinkers.  
[Page 110, Line 27] 67. And from the fruits of date -palms and 
[Page 110, Line 28] grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome 
[Page 110, Line 29] food. In this is a sign for people who under-
[Page 110, Line 30] stand.  
[Page 110, Line 31] 68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up 
[Page 110, Line 32] hives in the mountains, and in the trees, and 
[Page 110, Line 33] in what they construct.”  
[Page 110, Line 34] 69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the 
[Page 110, Line 35] pathways of your Lord, with precision. From 
[Page 110, Line 36] their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, 
[Page 110, Line 37] containing healing for the people. Surely in 
[Page 110, Line 38] this is a sign for people who reflect.  
[Page 110, Line 39] 70. Allah created you; then He takes you away. 
[Page 110, Line 40] Some of you will be brought back to the worst age, so that he will no longer know anything, after having acquired knowledge. Allah is 
[Page 110, Line 41] Omniscient and Omnipotent.  
[Page 110, Line 42] 71. Allah  has favored some of you over others 
[Page 110, Line 43] in livelihood. Those who are favored would 
[Page 110, Line 44] not give their properties to their servants, to 
[Page 110, Line 45] the extent of making them partners in it. Will they then renounce Allah’s blessings?  
[Page 110, Line 46] 72. Allah has given you mates from among 
[Page 110, Line 47] yourselves; and has produced for you, from 
[Page 110, Line 48] your mates, children and grandchildren; and 
[Page 110, Line 49] has provided you with good things. Will they 
[Page 110, Line 50] then believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah’s 
[Page 110, Line 51] favors?  
[Page 110, Line 52] 73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos-
[Page 110, Line 53] sesses no provisions for th em in the heavens, 
[Page 110, Line 54] nor on earth, nor are they capable.  
[Page 110, Line 55] 74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah 
[Page 110, Line 56] knows, and you do not know.  
[Page 110, Line 57] 75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave, 
[Page 110, Line 58] who has no power over anything; and some-
[Page 110, Line 59] one to whom We have given plentiful p rovi-
[Page 110, Line 60] sion, from which he gives secretly and 
[Page 110, Line 61] openly. Are they equal in comparison? All 
[Page 110, Line 62] praise belongs to Allah, but most of them do 
[Page 110, Line 63] not know.  
[Page 110, Line 64] 76. And Allah cites the example of two men: 
[Page 110, Line 65] one of them dumb, unable to do anything, 
[Page 110, Line 66] and is a burden on his master; whichever way 
[Page 110, Line 67] he directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is 
[Page 110, Line 68] he equal to him who commands justice, and 
[Page 110, Line 69] is on a straight path?  
[Page 110, Line 70] 77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens 
[Page 110, Line 71] and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only 
[Page 110, Line 72] as the twinkling of the eye, or even ne arer. Al-
[Page 110, Line 73] lah has power over everything.  
[Page 110, Line 74] 78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’ 
[Page 110, Line 75] wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the 
[Page 110, Line 76] brains; that you may give thanks.  
[Page 110, Line 77] 79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the 
[Page 110, Line 78] midst of  the sky? None sustains them except 
[Page 110, Line 79] Allah. In this are signs for people who believe.  
[Page 110, Line 80] 80. And Allah has given you in your homes 
[Page 110, Line 81] habitats for you, and has provided for you out 
[Page 110, Line 82] of the hides of livestock portable homes for 
[Page 110, Line 83] 99 
[Page 111, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 111, Line 2] you, so you can use them when you tra vel, 
[Page 111, Line 3] and when you camp; and from their wool, 
[Page 111, Line 4] and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort 
[Page 111, Line 5] for a while.  
[Page 111, Line 6] 81. And Allah has made for you shade out of 
[Page 111, Line 7] what He has created, and has given you re-
[Page 111, Line 8] sorts in the mountains, and has given you 
[Page 111, Line 9] garments to protect you from  the heat, and 
[Page 111, Line 10] garments to protect you from your violence. 
[Page 111, Line 11] Thus He completes His blessings upon you, 
[Page 111, Line 12] so that you may submit.  
[Page 111, Line 13] 82. But if they turn away, your only duty is 
[Page 111, Line 14] clear communication.  
[Page 111, Line 15] 83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then 
[Page 111, Line 16] deny it, as most of  them are ungrateful.  
[Page 111, Line 17] 84. On the Day when We raise up a witness 
[Page 111, Line 18] from every community —those who disbe-
[Page 111, Line 19] lieved will not be permitted, nor will they be 
[Page 111, Line 20] excused.  
[Page 111, Line 21] 85. When those who did wrong see the pun-
[Page 111, Line 22] ishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor 
[Page 111, Line 23] will they be reprieved.  
[Page 111, Line 24] 86. And when the idolaters see their associates, 
[Page 111, Line 25] they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ-
[Page 111, Line 26] ates whom we used to invoke besides You.” They will strike back at them with the saying, 
[Page 111, Line 27] “Surely you are liars.”  
[Page 111, Line 28] 87. On that Day they will offer their submis-
[Page 111, Line 29] sion to Allah, and what they had invented will 
[Page 111, Line 30] abandon them.  
[Page 111, Line 31] 88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from 
[Page 111, Line 32] Allah’s path— We will add punishment to 
[Page 111, Line 33] their punishment, on account of the mischief they used to make.  
[Page 111, Line 34] 89. On the Day when We raise in every  com-
[Page 111, Line 35] munity a witness against them, from among 
[Page 111, Line 36] them, and bring you as a witness against these. We have revealed to you the Book, as 
[Page 111, Line 37] an explanation of all things, and guidance, 
[Page 111, Line 38] and mercy and good news for those who sub-
[Page 111, Line 39] mit. 
[Page 111, Line 40] 90. Allah commands justice, and goo dness, 
[Page 111, Line 41] and generosity towards relatives. And He for-bids immorality, and injustice, and oppres-
[Page 111, Line 42] sion. He advises you, so that you may take 
[Page 111, Line 43] heed.  
[Page 111, Line 44] 91. Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you make a 
[Page 111, Line 45] covenant, and do not break your oaths after 
[Page 111, Line 46] ratifying them. You have made Allah your 
[Page 111, Line 47] guarantor, and Allah knows what you do.  
[Page 111, Line 48] 92. And do not be like her who unravels her 
[Page 111, Line 49] yarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has 
[Page 111, Line 50] spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means 
[Page 111, Line 51] of deception among you, because one com-
[Page 111, Line 52] munity is more prosperous than another. Al-
[Page 111, Line 53] lah is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res-
[Page 111, Line 54] urrection, He will make clear to you every-
[Page 111, Line 55] thing you had disputed about.  
[Page 111, Line 56] 93. Had Allah willed, He would have made you 
[Page 111, Line 57] one congregation, but He leaves astray whom 
[Page 111, Line 58] He wills, and He guides whom He w ills. And 
[Page 111, Line 59] you will surely be questioned about what you 
[Page 111, Line 60] used to do.  
[Page 111, Line 61] 94. And do not use your oaths to deceive one 
[Page 111, Line 62] another, so that a foot may not slip after being 
[Page 111, Line 63] firm, and you taste misery because you hin-dered from Allah’s path, and incur a terrible 
[Page 111, Line 64] torment.  
[Page 111, Line 65] 95. And do not exchange Allah’s covenant for 
[Page 111, Line 66] a small price. What is with Allah is better for 
[Page 111, Line 67] you, if you only knew.  
[Page 111, Line 68] 96. What you have runs out, but what is with 
[Page 111, Line 69] Allah remains. We will reward those who are patient according to the best of their deeds.  
[Page 111, Line 70] 97. Whoever works righteousness, whether 
[Page 111, Line 71] male or female, while being a believer, We 
[Page 111, Line 72] will grant him a good life —and We will re-
[Page 111, Line 73] ward them according to the best of what they 
[Page 111, Line 74] used to do.  
[Page 111, Line 75] 98. When you read the Quran, seek refuge 
[Page 111, Line 76] with Allah from Satan the outcast.  
[Page 111, Line 77] 99. He has no authority over those who believe 
[Page 111, Line 78] and trust in their Lord.  
[Page 111, Line 79] 100. His authority is only over those who fol-
[Page 111, Line 80] low him, and those who associate others with 
[Page 111, Line 81] Him.  
[Page 111, Line 82] 101. When We substitute a verse in place of an-
[Page 111, Line 83] other verse —and Allah knows best what He 
[Page 111, Line 84] 100 
[Page 112, Line 1] 16.  THE BEE   (an-Nahl)  
[Page 112, Line 2] reveals —they say, “You are an impostor.” But 
[Page 112, Line 3] most of them do not know.  
[Page 112, Line 4] 102. Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought it down 
[Page 112, Line 5] from your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabi-
[Page 112, Line 6] lize those who believe, and as guidance and 
[Page 112, Line 7] good news for those who submit.”  
[Page 112, Line 8] 103. We are well  aware that they say, “It is a hu-
[Page 112, Line 9] man being who is teaching him.” But the 
[Page 112, Line 10] tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while 
[Page 112, Line 11] this is a clear Arabic tongue.  
[Page 112, Line 12] 104. Those who do not believe in Allah’s reve-
[Page 112, Line 13] lations —Allah will not guide them, and for 
[Page 112, Line 14] them is a painful  punishment.  
[Page 112, Line 15] 105. It is those who do not believe in Allah’s 
[Page 112, Line 16] revelations who fabricate falsehood. These 
[Page 112, Line 17] are the liars.  
[Page 112, Line 18] 106. Whoever renounces faith in Allah after 
[Page 112, Line 19] having believed —except for someone who is 
[Page 112, Line 20] compelled, while his heart rests securely in 
[Page 112, Line 21] faith —but whoever willingly opens up his 
[Page 112, Line 22] heart to disbelief —upon them falls wrath 
[Page 112, Line 23] from Allah, and for them is a tremendous 
[Page 112, Line 24] torment.  
[Page 112, Line 25] 107. That is because they have preferred the 
[Page 112, Line 26] worldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al-
[Page 112, Line 27] lah does not guide the people who refuse.  
[Page 112, Line 28] 108. It is they whom Allah has sealed their 
[Page 112, Line 29] hearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is they who are the heedless.  
[Page 112, Line 30] 109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter 
[Page 112, Line 31] they will be the losers.  
[Page 112, Line 32] 110. But then your Lord —for those who emi-
[Page 112, Line 33] grated after being pers ecuted, then struggled 
[Page 112, Line 34] and persevered —your Lord thereafter is For-
[Page 112, Line 35] giving and Merciful.  
[Page 112, Line 36] 111. On the Day when every soul will come 
[Page 112, Line 37] pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid 
[Page 112, Line 38] in full for what it has done, and they will not 
[Page 112, Line 39] be wronged.  
[Page 112, Line 40] 112. And Allah cite s the example of a town that 
[Page 112, Line 41] was secure and peaceful, with its livelihood 
[Page 112, Line 42] coming to it abundantly from every direc-tion. But then it turned unappreciative of Al-
[Page 112, Line 43] lah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the robe of hunger and fear, because of what they used 
[Page 112, Line 44] to craft.  
[Page 112, Line 45] 113. A messenger from among them had come 
[Page 112, Line 46] to them, but they denounced him, so the 
[Page 112, Line 47] punishment seized them in the midst of their 
[Page 112, Line 48] wrongdoing.  
[Page 112, Line 49] 114. Eat of the lawful and good things Allah has 
[Page 112, Line 50] provided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s blessings, if it is Him that you serve.  
[Page 112, Line 51] 115. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, 
[Page 112, Line 52] and the flesh of swine, and anything conse-
[Page 112, Line 53] crated to other than Allah. But if anyone is 
[Page 112, Line 54] compelled by necessity, without being delib-
[Page 112, Line 55] erate or malicious, then Allah is Forgiving 
[Page 112, Line 56] and Mercif ul. 
[Page 112, Line 57] 116. And do not say of falsehood asserted by 
[Page 112, Line 58] your tongues, “This is lawful, and this is un-
[Page 112, Line 59] lawful,” in order to invent lies and attribute 
[Page 112, Line 60] them to Allah. Those who invent lies and at-
[Page 112, Line 61] tribute them to Allah will not succeed.  
[Page 112, Line 62] 117. A brief enjoyment —then they  will have a 
[Page 112, Line 63] painful punishment.  
[Page 112, Line 64] 118. For those who are Jews, We have prohib-
[Page 112, Line 65] ited what We related to you before. We did 
[Page 112, Line 66] not wrong them, but they used to wrong their 
[Page 112, Line 67] own selves.  
[Page 112, Line 68] 119. But towards those who do wrongs in igno-
[Page 112, Line 69] rance, and then repent afterwards and re-
[Page 112, Line 70] form, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and 
[Page 112, Line 71] Merciful.  
[Page 112, Line 72] 120. Abraham was an exemplary leader, de-
[Page 112, Line 73] voted to Allah, a monotheist, and was not of the polytheists.  
[Page 112, Line 74] 121. Thankful for His blessings. He chose him, 
[Page 112, Line 75] and guided him to a straight path.  
[Page 112, Line 76] 122. And We ga ve him goodness in this world, 
[Page 112, Line 77] and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.  
[Page 112, Line 78] 123. Then We inspired you: “Follow the reli-
[Page 112, Line 79] gion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was 
[Page 112, Line 80] not an idol -worshiper.”  
[Page 112, Line 81] 124. The Sabbath was decreed only for those 
[Page 112, Line 82] who differed about it. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection re-
[Page 112, Line 83] garding their differences.  
[Page 112, Line 84] 101 
[Page 113, Line 1] 17.  THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra’)  
[Page 113, Line 2] 125. Invite to the way of your Lord with wis-
[Page 113, Line 3] dom and good advice, and debate with them 
[Page 113, Line 4] in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is 
[Page 113, Line 5] aware of those who stray from His p ath, and 
[Page 113, Line 6] He is aware of those who are guided.  
[Page 113, Line 7] 126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the 
[Page 113, Line 8] same degree as the injury done to you. But if 
[Page 113, Line 9] you resort to patience —it is better for the pa-
[Page 113, Line 10] tient.  
[Page 113, Line 11] 127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from 
[Page 113, Line 12] Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do 
[Page 113, Line 13] not be stressed by their schemes.  
[Page 113, Line 14] 128. Allah is with those who are righteous and 
[Page 113, Line 15] those who are virtuous.  

[Page 113, Line 17] 17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY  
[Page 113, Line 18] (al-Isra’ ) 
[Page 113, Line 19] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 113, Line 20] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 113, Line 21] 1. Glory to Him who journeyed His serv ant by 
[Page 113, Line 22] night, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far-
[Page 113, Line 23] thest Mosque, whose precincts We have 
[Page 113, Line 24] blessed, in order to show him of Our won-
[Page 113, Line 25] ders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.  
[Page 113, Line 26] 2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and 
[Page 113, Line 27] made it a guide for the Children of Israel: Take none for protector other than Me.  
[Page 113, Line 28] 3. The descendants of those We carried with 
[Page 113, Line 29] Noah. He was an appreciative servant.  
[Page 113, Line 30] 4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel 
[Page 113, Line 31] in the Scripture: You will commit evil on 
[Page 113, Line 32] earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.  
[Page 113, Line 33] 5. When the first of the two promises came 
[Page 113, Line 34] true, We sent against you servants of Ours, 
[Page 113, Line 35] possessing great might, and they ransacked 
[Page 113, Line 36] your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.  
[Page 113, Line 37] 6. Then We gave you back your turn against 
[Page 113, Line 38] them, and supplied you with wealth and chil-
[Page 113, Line 39] dren, and made you more numerous.  
[Page 113, Line 40] 7. If you work righteousness, you work right-
[Page 113, Line 41] eousness for yourselves; and if you commit evil, you do so against yourselves. Then, 
[Page 113, Line 42] when the second promise comes true, they 
[Page 113, Line 43] will make your faces filled with sorrow, and enter the Temple as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy all that falls into 
[Page 113, Line 44] their power.  
[Page 113, Line 45] 8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. 
[Page 113, Line 46] But if you revert, We will revert. We have 
[Page 113, Line 47] made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.  
[Page 113, Line 48] 9. This Quran guides to what is most upright; 
[Page 113, Line 49] and it gives good news to the believers who 
[Page 113, Line 50] do good deeds, that they will have a great re-
[Page 113, Line 51] ward.  
[Page 113, Line 52] 10. And those who do not believe in the Here-
[Page 113, Line 53] after —We have prepared for them a painful 
[Page 113, Line 54] punishment.  
[Page 113, Line 55] 11. The human being prays for evil as he prays 
[Page 113, Line 56] for good. The human being is very hasty.  
[Page 113, Line 57] 12. We have made the night and the day two 
[Page 113, Line 58] wonders. We erased the wonder of the night, 
[Page 113, Line 59] and made the wonder of the day revealing, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, 
[Page 113, Line 60] and know the numbe r of years, and the cal-
[Page 113, Line 61] culation. We have explained all things in de-
[Page 113, Line 62] tail. 
[Page 113, Line 63] 13. For every person We have attached his fate 
[Page 113, Line 64] to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection, 
[Page 113, Line 65] We will bring out for him a book which he 
[Page 113, Line 66] will find spread open.  
[Page 113, Line 67] 14. “Read your book; today  there will be none 
[Page 113, Line 68] but yourself to call you to account.”  
[Page 113, Line 69] 15. Whoever is guided —is guided for his own 
[Page 113, Line 70] good. And whoever goes astray —goes astray 
[Page 113, Line 71] to his detriment. No burdened soul carries 
[Page 113, Line 72] the burdens of another, nor do We ever pun-
[Page 113, Line 73] ish until We have sent a me ssenger.  
[Page 113, Line 74] 16. When We decide to destroy a town, We 
[Page 113, Line 75] command its affluent ones, they transgress in 
[Page 113, Line 76] it, so the word becomes justified against it, 
[Page 113, Line 77] and We destroy it completely.  
[Page 113, Line 78] 17. How many generations have We destroyed 
[Page 113, Line 79] after Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as 
[Page 113, Line 80] Knower and Beholder of the sins of his serv-
[Page 113, Line 81] ants.  
[Page 113, Line 82] 18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe-
[Page 113, Line 83] dite for him what We decide to give him, to whomever We desire. Then We consign him 
[Page 113, Line 84] 102 
[Page 114, Line 1] 17.  THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra’)  
[Page 114, Line 2] to Hell, where he will roast, condemned and 
[Page 114, Line 3] defeated.  
[Page 114, Line 4] 19. But whoever desires t he Hereafter, and 
[Page 114, Line 5] pursues it as it should be pursued, while he is 
[Page 114, Line 6] a believer; these —their effort will be appreci-
[Page 114, Line 7] ated.  
[Page 114, Line 8] 20. To all —these and those —We extend from 
[Page 114, Line 9] the gifts of your Lord. The gifts of your Lord 
[Page 114, Line 10] are not restricted.  
[Page 114, Line 11] 21. See how We have favored s ome of them 
[Page 114, Line 12] over others; yet the Hereafter is greater in 
[Page 114, Line 13] ranks, and greater in favors.  
[Page 114, Line 14] 22. Do not set up another god with Allah, lest 
[Page 114, Line 15] you become condemned and damned.  
[Page 114, Line 16] 23. Your Lord has commanded that you wor-
[Page 114, Line 17] ship none but Him, and that you be good to 
[Page 114, Line 18] your p arents. If either of them or both of 
[Page 114, Line 19] them reach old age with you, do not say to 
[Page 114, Line 20] them a word of disrespect, nor scold them, 
[Page 114, Line 21] but say to them kind words.  
[Page 114, Line 22] 24. And lower to them the wing of humility, 
[Page 114, Line 23] out of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy 
[Page 114, Line 24] on them, as they raised me when I was a 
[Page 114, Line 25] child.”  
[Page 114, Line 26] 25. Your Lord knows best what is in your 
[Page 114, Line 27] minds. If you are righteous —He is Forgiving 
[Page 114, Line 28] to the obedient.  
[Page 114, Line 29] 26. And give the relative his rights, and the 
[Page 114, Line 30] poor, and the wayfarer, and do not squander 
[Page 114, Line 31] wastefully.  
[Page 114, Line 32] 27. The extravagant are brethren of the devils, 
[Page 114, Line 33] and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.  
[Page 114, Line 34] 28. But if you turn away from them, seeking 
[Page 114, Line 35] mercy from your Lord which you hope for, then say to them words of comfort.  
[Page 114, Line 36] 29. And do not keep your hand tied to your 
[Page 114, Line 37] neck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up 
[Page 114, Line 38] liable and regretful.  
[Page 114, Line 39] 30. Your Lord expands the provision for 
[Page 114, Line 40] whomever He wills, and restricts it. He is 
[Page 114, Line 41] fully Informed, Observant of His servants.  
[Page 114, Line 42] 31. And do not kill your children for fear of 
[Page 114, Line 43] poverty. We provide for them, and f or you. 
[Page 114, Line 44] Killing them is a grave sin.  32. And do not come near adultery. It is im-
[Page 114, Line 45] moral, and an evil way.  
[Page 114, Line 46] 33. And do not kill the soul which Allah has 
[Page 114, Line 47] made sacred, except in the course of justice. 
[Page 114, Line 48] If someone is killed unjustly, We have given 
[Page 114, Line 49] his next of kin certain authority. But he 
[Page 114, Line 50] should not be excessive in killing, for he will 
[Page 114, Line 51] be supported.  
[Page 114, Line 52] 34. And do not go near the orphan’s property, 
[Page 114, Line 53] except with the best of intentions, until he has 
[Page 114, Line 54] reached his maturity. And honor your 
[Page 114, Line 55] pledge, because the pledge involves responsi-
[Page 114, Line 56] bility.  
[Page 114, Line 57] 35. And give full measure when you measure, 
[Page 114, Line 58] and weigh with accurate scales. That is fair, 
[Page 114, Line 59] and the best determination.  
[Page 114, Line 60] 36. And do not occupy yourself with what you 
[Page 114, Line 61] have no knowledge of. The hearing, and the 
[Page 114, Line 62] sight, and the brains —all these will be ques-
[Page 114, Line 63] tioned.  
[Page 114, Line 64] 37. And do not walk proudly on earth. You can 
[Page 114, Line 65] neither pierce the earth, nor can you match 
[Page 114, Line 66] the mountains in height.  
[Page 114, Line 67] 38. The evil of all these is disliked by your 
[Page 114, Line 68] Lord.  
[Page 114, Line 69] 39. That is some of the wisdom your Lord has 
[Page 114, Line 70] revealed to you. Do not set up with Allah an-
[Page 114, Line 71] other god, or else you will be thrown in Hell, 
[Page 114, Line 72] rebuked and banished.  
[Page 114, Line 73] 40. Has your Lord favored you with sons, 
[Page 114, Line 74] while choosing for Himself daughters from 
[Page 114, Line 75] among the angels? You are indeed saying a 
[Page 114, Line 76] terrible thing.  
[Page 114, Line 77] 41. We have explained in t his Quran in various 
[Page 114, Line 78] ways, that they may remember, but it only 
[Page 114, Line 79] adds to their rebellion.  
[Page 114, Line 80] 42. Say, “If there were other gods with Him, as 
[Page 114, Line 81] they say, they would have sought a way to the 
[Page 114, Line 82] Lord of the Throne.”  
[Page 114, Line 83] 43. Be He glorified. He is exalted, far above 
[Page 114, Line 84] what th ey say.  
[Page 114, Line 85] 44. Praising Him are the seven heavens, and 
[Page 114, Line 86] the earth, and everyone in them. There is not 
[Page 114, Line 87] a thing that does not glorify Him with praise, 
[Page 114, Line 88] 103 
[Page 115, Line 1] 17.  THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra’)  
[Page 115, Line 2] but you do not understand their praises. He 
[Page 115, Line 3] is indeed Forbearing and Forgiving.  
[Page 115, Line 4] 45. When you read the Quran, We  place be-
[Page 115, Line 5] tween you and those who do not believe in 
[Page 115, Line 6] the Hereafter an invisible barrier.  
[Page 115, Line 7] 46. And We drape veils over their hearts, pre-
[Page 115, Line 8] venting them from understanding it, and 
[Page 115, Line 9] heaviness in their ears. And when you men-
[Page 115, Line 10] tion your Lord alone in the Quran, they tur n 
[Page 115, Line 11] their backs in aversion.  
[Page 115, Line 12] 47. We know well what they listen to, when 
[Page 115, Line 13] they listen to you, as they conspire, when the wrongdoers say, “You only follow a man be-
[Page 115, Line 14] witched.”  
[Page 115, Line 15] 48. Note what they compared you to. They are 
[Page 115, Line 16] lost, and unable to find a way.  
[Page 115, Line 17] 49. And they say, “When we have become 
[Page 115, Line 18] bones and fragments, shall we really be resur-rected as a new creation?”  
[Page 115, Line 19] 50. Say, “Even if you become rocks or iron.  
[Page 115, Line 20] 51. Or some substance, which, in your minds, 
[Page 115, Line 21] is even harder.” Then they will say, “Who will 
[Page 115, Line 22] restore us?” Say,  “The One who originated 
[Page 115, Line 23] you the first time.” Then they will nod their 
[Page 115, Line 24] heads at you, and say, “When will it be?” Say, 
[Page 115, Line 25] “Perhaps it will be soon.”  
[Page 115, Line 26] 52. On the Day when He calls you, you will re-
[Page 115, Line 27] spond with His praise, and you will realize 
[Page 115, Line 28] that you stayed only a  little.  
[Page 115, Line 29] 53. Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan 
[Page 115, Line 30] sows discord among them. Satan is to man an 
[Page 115, Line 31] open enemy.  
[Page 115, Line 32] 54. Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He 
[Page 115, Line 33] will have mercy on you; and if He wills, He 
[Page 115, Line 34] will punish you. We did not send you as their 
[Page 115, Line 35] advocate.  
[Page 115, Line 36] 55. Your Lord knows well everyone in the 
[Page 115, Line 37] heavens and the earth. We have given some 
[Page 115, Line 38] prophets advantage over others; and to David 
[Page 115, Line 39] We gave the Psalms.  
[Page 115, Line 40] 56. Say, “Call upon those you claim besides 
[Page 115, Line 41] Him. They have no power to relieve your ad-versity, nor can t hey change it.” 57. Those they call upon are themselves seek-
[Page 115, Line 42] ing means of access to their Lord, vying to be 
[Page 115, Line 43] nearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fear-
[Page 115, Line 44] ing His punishment. The punishment of your 
[Page 115, Line 45] Lord is to be dreaded.  
[Page 115, Line 46] 58. There is no city but We will destroy before 
[Page 115, Line 47] the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a 
[Page 115, Line 48] severe punishment. This is inscribed in the 
[Page 115, Line 49] Book.  
[Page 115, Line 50] 59. Nothing prevents Us from sending mirac-
[Page 115, Line 51] ulous signs, except that the ancients called 
[Page 115, Line 52] them lies. We gave Thamood the she -camel, 
[Page 115, Line 53] a visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do 
[Page 115, Line 54] not send the signs except to instill reverence.  
[Page 115, Line 55] 60. We said to you that your Lord encom-
[Page 115, Line 56] passes humanity. We did not make the vision We showed you, except as a test for the peo-
[Page 115, Line 57] ple, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We 
[Page 115, Line 58] frighten them, but that only increases their 
[Page 115, Line 59] defiance.  
[Page 115, Line 60] 61. When We said to the angels, “Bow down 
[Page 115, Line 61] before Adam,” they bowed down, except for Satan. He said, “Shall I bow down before 
[Page 115, Line 62] someone You created from mud?”  
[Page 115, Line 63] 62. He said, “Do You see this one whom You 
[Page 115, Line 64] have honored more than me? If You reprieve 
[Page 115, Line 65] me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his descendants under my sway, except for a few.”  
[Page 115, Line 66] 63. He said, “Begone! Whoever of them fol-
[Page 115, Line 67] lows you —Hell is your reward, an ample re-
[Page 115, Line 68] ward.”  
[Page 115, Line 69] 64. “And entice whomever of them you can 
[Page 115, Line 70] with your voice, and rally against them your 
[Page 115, Line 71] cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and make 
[Page 115, Line 72] promises to them.” But Satan promises them 
[Page 115, Line 73] nothing but delusion.  
[Page 115, Line 74] 65. “As for My devotees, you have no authority 
[Page 115, Line 75] over them.” Your Lord is  an adequate Guard-
[Page 115, Line 76] ian. 
[Page 115, Line 77] 66. Your Lord is He who propels for you the 
[Page 115, Line 78] ships at sea, that you may seek of His bounty. 
[Page 115, Line 79] He is towards you Most Merciful.  
[Page 115, Line 80] 104 
[Page 116, Line 1] 17.  THE NIGHT JOURNEY   (al-Isra’)  
[Page 116, Line 2] 67. When harm afflicts you at sea, those you 
[Page 116, Line 3] pray to vanish, except for Him. But when He 
[Page 116, Line 4] saves you to land, y ou turn away. The human 
[Page 116, Line 5] being is ever thankless.  
[Page 116, Line 6] 68. Are you confident that He will not cause a 
[Page 116, Line 7] track of land to cave in beneath you, or un-leash a tornado against you, and then you 
[Page 116, Line 8] find no protector?  
[Page 116, Line 9] 69. Or are you confident that He will not re-
[Page 116, Line 10] turn you to it once again, and unleash a hur-
[Page 116, Line 11] ricane against you, and drown you for your 
[Page 116, Line 12] ingratitude? Then you will find no helper 
[Page 116, Line 13] against Us.  
[Page 116, Line 14] 70. We have honored the Children of Adam, 
[Page 116, Line 15] and carried them on land and sea, and pro-
[Page 116, Line 16] vided them with good things, and greatly fa-
[Page 116, Line 17] vored them over many of those We created.  
[Page 116, Line 18] 71. On the Day when We call every people with 
[Page 116, Line 19] their leader. Whoever is given his record in 
[Page 116, Line 20] his right hand —these will read their record, 
[Page 116, Line 21] and they will not be wronged one bit.  
[Page 116, Line 22] 72. But whoever is blind in this, he will  be 
[Page 116, Line 23] blind in the Hereafter, and further astray 
[Page 116, Line 24] from the way.  
[Page 116, Line 25] 73. They almost lured you away from what We 
[Page 116, Line 26] have revealed to you, so that you would in-
[Page 116, Line 27] vent something else in Our name. In that 
[Page 116, Line 28] case, they would have taken you for a friend.  
[Page 116, Line 29] 74. Had We not given y ou stability, you might 
[Page 116, Line 30] have inclined towards them a little.  
[Page 116, Line 31] 75. Then We would have made you taste dou-
[Page 116, Line 32] ble in life, and double at death; then you 
[Page 116, Line 33] would have found for yourself no helper 
[Page 116, Line 34] against Us.  
[Page 116, Line 35] 76. They almost provoked you, to expel you 
[Page 116, Line 36] from the land. In that case, they would not have lasted after you, except briefly.  
[Page 116, Line 37] 77. The tradition of the messengers We sent 
[Page 116, Line 38] before you —you will find no change in Our 
[Page 116, Line 39] rules.  
[Page 116, Line 40] 78. Perform the prayer at the decline of the 
[Page 116, Line 41] sun, until the darkness of the night; and the 
[Page 116, Line 42] Quran at dawn. The Quran at dawn is wit-
[Page 116, Line 43] nessed.  79. And keep vigil with it during parts of the 
[Page 116, Line 44] night, as an extra prayer. Perhaps your Lord 
[Page 116, Line 45] will raise you to a laudable position.  
[Page 116, Line 46] 80. And say, “My Lord, lead me in through an 
[Page 116, Line 47] entry of truth, and lead me out throug h an 
[Page 116, Line 48] exit of truth, and grant me from You a sup-porting power.”  
[Page 116, Line 49] 81. And say, “The truth has come, and false-
[Page 116, Line 50] hood has withered away; for falsehood is 
[Page 116, Line 51] bound to wither away.”  
[Page 116, Line 52] 82. We send down in the Quran healing and 
[Page 116, Line 53] mercy for the believers, but it increases th e 
[Page 116, Line 54] wrongdoers only in loss.  
[Page 116, Line 55] 83. When We bless the human being, he turns 
[Page 116, Line 56] away and distances himself. But when adver-
[Page 116, Line 57] sity touches him, he is in despair.  
[Page 116, Line 58] 84. Say, “Each does according to his disposi-
[Page 116, Line 59] tion. Your Lord knows best who is better 
[Page 116, Line 60] guided in the way.”  
[Page 116, Line 61] 85. And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, 
[Page 116, Line 62] “The Spirit belongs to the domain of my 
[Page 116, Line 63] Lord; and you were given only little 
[Page 116, Line 64] knowledge.”  
[Page 116, Line 65] 86. If We willed, We could take away what We 
[Page 116, Line 66] revealed to you. Then you will find for your-self no protecting guardian against Us.  
[Page 116, Line 67] 87. Except through a mercy from your Lord. 
[Page 116, Line 68] His favors upon you have been great.  
[Page 116, Line 69] 88. Say, “If mankind and jinn came together to 
[Page 116, Line 70] produce the like of this Quran, they could 
[Page 116, Line 71] never produce the like of it, even if they 
[Page 116, Line 72] backed up one another.”  
[Page 116, Line 73] 89. We have dis played for mankind in this 
[Page 116, Line 74] Quran every kind of similitude, but most people insist on denying the truth.  
[Page 116, Line 75] 90. And they said, “We will not believe in you 
[Page 116, Line 76] unless you make a spring burst from the 
[Page 116, Line 77] ground for us.  
[Page 116, Line 78] 91. Or you have a garden of palms and vines; 
[Page 116, Line 79] then cause rivers to gush pouring through 
[Page 116, Line 80] them.  
[Page 116, Line 81] 92. Or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you 
[Page 116, Line 82] claim, or bring Allah and the angels before us.  
[Page 116, Line 83] 105 
[Page 117, Line 1] 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
[Page 117, Line 2] 93. Or you possess a house of gold. Or you as-
[Page 117, Line 3] cend into the sky. Even then, we will not be-
[Page 117, Line 4] lieve in your ascension, unless you bring 
[Page 117, Line 5] down for us a book that we can read.” Say, 
[Page 117, Line 6] “Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a 
[Page 117, Line 7] human messenger?”  
[Page 117, Line 8] 94. Nothing prevented the people from believ-
[Page 117, Line 9] ing, when guidance has come to them, except 
[Page 117, Line 10] that they said, “Did Allah send a human mes-
[Page 117, Line 11] senge r?” 
[Page 117, Line 12] 95. Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking 
[Page 117, Line 13] around in peace, We would have sent down 
[Page 117, Line 14] to them from heaven an angel messenger.”  
[Page 117, Line 15] 96. Say, “Allah is enough witness between you 
[Page 117, Line 16] and me. He is fully aware of His servants, and He sees them well.”  
[Page 117, Line 17] 97. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one. 
[Page 117, Line 18] And whomever He leaves astray —for them 
[Page 117, Line 19] you will find no protectors apart from Him. 
[Page 117, Line 20] And We will gather them on the Day of Res-
[Page 117, Line 21] urrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and 
[Page 117, Line 22] deaf. Their abode is Hell; whenever it abates, 
[Page 117, Line 23] We intensify the blaze for them.  
[Page 117, Line 24] 98. This is their repayment for having blas-
[Page 117, Line 25] phemed against Our revelations, and having 
[Page 117, Line 26] said, “Shall we, when we have become bones 
[Page 117, Line 27] and fragments, be resurrected as a new crea-
[Page 117, Line 28] tion?”  
[Page 117, Line 29] 99. Do they not consider that Allah, Who cre-
[Page 117, Line 30] ated the heavens and the earth, is Able to cre-
[Page 117, Line 31] ate the likes of them? He has assigned for them a term, in which there is no doubt. But 
[Page 117, Line 32] the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.  
[Page 117, Line 33] 100. Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my 
[Page 117, Line 34] Lord’s mercy, you would have  withheld them 
[Page 117, Line 35] for fear of spending.” The human being has 
[Page 117, Line 36] always been stingy.  
[Page 117, Line 37] 101. We gave Moses nine clear signs —ask the 
[Page 117, Line 38] Children of Israel. When he went to them, 
[Page 117, Line 39] Pharaoh said to him, “I think that you, Mo-
[Page 117, Line 40] ses, are bewitched.”  
[Page 117, Line 41] 102. He said, “You know that none sent these 
[Page 117, Line 42] down except the Lord of the heavens and the 
[Page 117, Line 43] earth —eye openers; and I think that you, 
[Page 117, Line 44] Pharaoh, are doomed.”  103. He resolved to scare them off the land, but 
[Page 117, Line 45] We drowned him, and those with him, alto-
[Page 117, Line 46] gether.  
[Page 117, Line 47] 104. After him, We said to the Child ren of Is-
[Page 117, Line 48] rael, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise 
[Page 117, Line 49] of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all 
[Page 117, Line 50] together.”  
[Page 117, Line 51] 105. With the truth We sent it down, and with 
[Page 117, Line 52] the truth it descended. We sent you only as a 
[Page 117, Line 53] bearer of good news and a warner.  
[Page 117, Line 54] 106. A Quran whi ch We unfolded gradually, 
[Page 117, Line 55] that you may recite to the people over time. And We revealed it in stages.  
[Page 117, Line 56] 107. Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.” 
[Page 117, Line 57] Those who were given knowledge before it, 
[Page 117, Line 58] when it is recited to them, they fall to their 
[Page 117, Line 59] chins, prostrating.  
[Page 117, Line 60] 108. And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The 
[Page 117, Line 61] promise of our Lord is fulfilled.” 
[Page 117, Line 62] 109. And they fall to their chins, weeping, and 
[Page 117, Line 63] it adds to their humility.  
[Page 117, Line 64] 110. Say, “Call Him Allah, or call Him the Most 
[Page 117, Line 65] Merciful. Whichever name you use, to Him 
[Page 117, Line 66] belong the Bes t Names.” And be neither loud 
[Page 117, Line 67] in your prayer, nor silent in it, but follow a 
[Page 117, Line 68] course in between.  
[Page 117, Line 69] 111. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not 
[Page 117, Line 70] begotten a son, nor has He a partner in sov-
[Page 117, Line 71] ereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness, 
[Page 117, Line 72] and glorify Him constant ly.” 

[Page 117, Line 74] 18. THE CAVE  
[Page 117, Line 75] (al-Kahf)  
[Page 117, Line 76] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 117, Line 77] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 117, Line 78] 1. Praise be to Allah, who revealed the Book to 
[Page 117, Line 79] His servant, and allowed in it no distortion.  
[Page 117, Line 80] 2. Valuable —to warn of severe punishment 
[Page 117, Line 81] from Himself; and to deliver good news to the 
[Page 117, Line 82] believers who do righteous deeds, that they 
[Page 117, Line 83] will have an excellent reward.  
[Page 117, Line 84] 3. In which they will abide forever.  
[Page 117, Line 85] 106 
[Page 118, Line 1] 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
[Page 118, Line 2] 4. And to warn those who say, “Allah has be-
[Page 118, Line 3] gotten a son.”  
[Page 118, Line 4] 5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did 
[Page 118, Line 5] their forefathers. Grave is the word that 
[Page 118, Line 6] comes out of their mouths. They say nothing 
[Page 118, Line 7] but a lie.  
[Page 118, Line 8] 6. Perhaps you may destroy yourself with 
[Page 118, Line 9] grief, chasing after them, if they do not be-lieve in this information.  
[Page 118, Line 10] 7. We made what is upon the earth an orna-
[Page 118, Line 11] ment for it, to test them as to which of them 
[Page 118, Line 12] is best in conduct.  
[Page 118, Line 13] 8. And We will turn what is on it into barren 
[Page 118, Line 14] waste.  
[Page 118, Line 15] 9. Did you know that the People of the Cave 
[Page 118, Line 16] and the Inscription were of Our wondrous signs?  
[Page 118, Line 17] 10. When t he youths took shelter in the cave, 
[Page 118, Line 18] they said, “Our Lord, give us mercy from 
[Page 118, Line 19] Yourself, and bless our affair with guidance.”  
[Page 118, Line 20] 11. Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a 
[Page 118, Line 21] number of years.  
[Page 118, Line 22] 12. Then We awakened them to know which 
[Page 118, Line 23] of the two groups could better calculate the length of their stay.  
[Page 118, Line 24] 13. We relate to you their story in truth. They 
[Page 118, Line 25] were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.  
[Page 118, Line 26] 14. And We strengthened their hearts, when 
[Page 118, Line 27] they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord 
[Page 118, Line 28] of the heavens and the earth; we will not call 
[Page 118, Line 29] on any god besides Him, for then we would 
[Page 118, Line 30] have spoken an outrage.”  
[Page 118, Line 31] 15. “These people, our people, have taken to 
[Page 118, Line 32] themselves gods other than Him. Why do 
[Page 118, Line 33] they not bring a clear proof concerning them? Who, then, does greater wrong than he 
[Page 118, Line 34] who invents lies and attributes them to Al-
[Page 118, Line 35] lah?”  
[Page 118, Line 36] 16. “Now that you have withdrawn from them, 
[Page 118, Line 37] and from what they worship besides Allah, 
[Page 118, Line 38] take shelter in the cave. And your Lord will 
[Page 118, Line 39] unfold His mercy for you, and will set your 
[Page 118, Line 40] affair towards ease.”  17. You would have seen the sun, when it rose, 
[Page 118, Line 41] veering away from their cave towards the 
[Page 118, Line 42] right, and when it sets, moving away from 
[Page 118, Line 43] them to the left, as they lay in the midst of the 
[Page 118, Line 44] cave. That was one of Allah’s wonders. He 
[Page 118, Line 45] whom Allah guides i s truly guided; but he 
[Page 118, Line 46] whom He misguides, for him you will find no 
[Page 118, Line 47] directing friend.  
[Page 118, Line 48] 18. You would think them awake, although 
[Page 118, Line 49] they were asleep. And We turned them over 
[Page 118, Line 50] to the right, and to the left, with their dog stretching its paws across the threshold. Had 
[Page 118, Line 51] you looked at them, you would have turned 
[Page 118, Line 52] away from them in flight, and been filled with 
[Page 118, Line 53] fear of them.  
[Page 118, Line 54] 19. Even so, We awakened them, so that they 
[Page 118, Line 55] may ask one another. A speaker among them 
[Page 118, Line 56] said, “How long have you stayed?” They said, “We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” They 
[Page 118, Line 57] said, “Your Lord knows best how long you 
[Page 118, Line 58] have stayed.” “Send one of you to the city, 
[Page 118, Line 59] with this money of yours, and let him see 
[Page 118, Line 60] which food is most suitable, and let him bring 
[Page 118, Line 61] you some provision thereof. And let him be 
[Page 118, Line 62] gentle, an d let no one become aware of you.”  
[Page 118, Line 63] 20. “If they discover you, they will stone you, 
[Page 118, Line 64] or force you back into their religion; then you 
[Page 118, Line 65] will never be saved.”  
[Page 118, Line 66] 21. So it was, that We caused them to be dis-
[Page 118, Line 67] covered, that they would know that the 
[Page 118, Line 68] promise of Allah is true, and that of the Hour 
[Page 118, Line 69] there is no doubt. As they were disputing 
[Page 118, Line 70] their case among themselves, they said, 
[Page 118, Line 71] “Build over them a building.” Their Lord 
[Page 118, Line 72] knows best about them. Those who prevailed 
[Page 118, Line 73] over their case said, “We will set up over them 
[Page 118, Line 74] a place of wors hip.”  
[Page 118, Line 75] 22. They will say, “Three, and their fourth be-
[Page 118, Line 76] ing their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and 
[Page 118, Line 77] their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the 
[Page 118, Line 78] unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and 
[Page 118, Line 79] their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord 
[Page 118, Line 80] knows best their number.” N one knows them 
[Page 118, Line 81] except a few. So do not argue concerning them except with an obvious argument, and 
[Page 118, Line 82] do not consult any of them about them.  
[Page 118, Line 83] 107 
[Page 119, Line 1] 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
[Page 119, Line 2] 23. And never say about anything, “I will do 
[Page 119, Line 3] that tomorrow.”  
[Page 119, Line 4] 24. Without saying, “If Allah wills.” And re-
[Page 119, Line 5] member your Lo rd if you forget, and say, 
[Page 119, Line 6] “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer 
[Page 119, Line 7] than this in integrity.”  
[Page 119, Line 8] 25. And they stayed in their cave for three hun-
[Page 119, Line 9] dred years, adding nine.  
[Page 119, Line 10] 26. Say, “Allah knows best how long they 
[Page 119, Line 11] stayed.” His is the mystery of the heavens and 
[Page 119, Line 12] the earth. By Him you see and hear. They 
[Page 119, Line 13] have no guardian apart from Him, and He 
[Page 119, Line 14] shares His Sovereignty with no one.  
[Page 119, Line 15] 27. And recite what was revealed to you from 
[Page 119, Line 16] the Book of your Lord. There is no changing 
[Page 119, Line 17] His words, and you will find no refuge except 
[Page 119, Line 18] in Him.  
[Page 119, Line 19] 28. And content yourself with those who pray 
[Page 119, Line 20] to their Lord morning and evening, desiring 
[Page 119, Line 21] His Presence. And do not turn your eyes 
[Page 119, Line 22] away from them, desiring the glitter of this 
[Page 119, Line 23] world. And do not obey him whose heart We 
[Page 119, Line 24] have made heedless of Our remembrance —
[Page 119, Line 25] so he follows his own desires —and his prior-
[Page 119, Line 26] ities are confused.  
[Page 119, Line 27] 29. And say, “The truth is from your Lord. 
[Page 119, Line 28] Whoever wills —let him believe. And who-
[Page 119, Line 29] ever wills —let him disbelieve”. We have pre-
[Page 119, Line 30] pared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains 
[Page 119, Line 31] will hem them in. And when  they cry for re-
[Page 119, Line 32] lief, they will be relieved with water like mol-
[Page 119, Line 33] ten brass, which scalds the faces. What a mis-
[Page 119, Line 34] erable drink, and what a terrible place.  
[Page 119, Line 35] 30. As for those who believe and lead a right-
[Page 119, Line 36] eous life— We will not waste the reward of 
[Page 119, Line 37] those who work right eousness.  
[Page 119, Line 38] 31. These will have the Gardens of Eden, be-
[Page 119, Line 39] neath which rivers flow. Reclining on com-
[Page 119, Line 40] fortable furnishings, they will be adorned 
[Page 119, Line 41] with bracelets of gold, and will wear green 
[Page 119, Line 42] garments of silk and brocade. What a won-
[Page 119, Line 43] derful reward, and what an excellent resting -
[Page 119, Line 44] place.  
[Page 119, Line 45] 32. And cite for them the parable of two men. 
[Page 119, Line 46] To one of them We gave two gardens of vine, and We surrounded them with palm -trees, 
[Page 119, Line 47] and We placed between them crops.  
[Page 119, Line 48] 33. Both gardens produced their harvest in 
[Page 119, Line 49] full, and suffered no lo ss. And We made a 
[Page 119, Line 50] river flow through them.  
[Page 119, Line 51] 34. And thus he had abundant fruits. He said 
[Page 119, Line 52] to his friend, as he conversed with him, “I am 
[Page 119, Line 53] wealthier than you, and greater in man-
[Page 119, Line 54] power.”  
[Page 119, Line 55] 35. And he entered his garden, wronging him-
[Page 119, Line 56] self. He said, “I do not think t his will ever per-
[Page 119, Line 57] ish.”  
[Page 119, Line 58] 36. “And I do not think the Hour is coming. 
[Page 119, Line 59] And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find something better than this in return.”  
[Page 119, Line 60] 37. His friend said to him, as he conversed 
[Page 119, Line 61] with him, “Are you being ungrateful to Him 
[Page 119, Line 62] who created y ou from dust, then from a 
[Page 119, Line 63] sperm -drop, then evolved you into a man?  
[Page 119, Line 64] 38. But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I 
[Page 119, Line 65] never associate with my Lord anyone.  
[Page 119, Line 66] 39. When you entered your garden, why did 
[Page 119, Line 67] you not say, “As Allah wills; there is no power 
[Page 119, Line 68] except through Allah”? Although you see me 
[Page 119, Line 69] inferior to you in wealth and children.  
[Page 119, Line 70] 40. Perhaps my Lord will give me something 
[Page 119, Line 71] better than your garden, and release upon it thunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes bar-
[Page 119, Line 72] ren waste.  
[Page 119, Line 73] 41. Or its water will sink into the ground, a nd 
[Page 119, Line 74] you will be unable to draw it.”  
[Page 119, Line 75] 42. And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he 
[Page 119, Line 76] began wringing his hands over what he had 
[Page 119, Line 77] invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. 
[Page 119, Line 78] And he was saying, “I wish I never associated 
[Page 119, Line 79] anyone with my Lord.”  
[Page 119, Line 80] 43. He had  no faction to help him besides Al-
[Page 119, Line 81] lah, and he was helpless.  
[Page 119, Line 82] 44. That is because authority belongs to Allah, 
[Page 119, Line 83] the True. He is Best in rewarding, and Best in requiting.  
[Page 119, Line 84] 45. And cite for them the parable of the pre-
[Page 119, Line 85] sent life: it is like water that We send down 
[Page 119, Line 86] from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it; 
[Page 119, Line 87] 108 
[Page 120, Line 1] 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
[Page 120, Line 2] but then it becomes debris, scattered by the 
[Page 120, Line 3] wind. Allah has absolute power over every-
[Page 120, Line 4] thing.  
[Page 120, Line 5] 46. Wealth and children are the adornments of 
[Page 120, Line 6] the present life. But the things that last, the 
[Page 120, Line 7] virtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for 
[Page 120, Line 8] reward, and better for hope.  
[Page 120, Line 9] 47. On the Day when We set the mountains in 
[Page 120, Line 10] motion; and you see the earth emerging; and 
[Page 120, Line 11] We gather them together, and leave none of 
[Page 120, Line 12] them behind.  
[Page 120, Line 13] 48. They will be presented before your Lord in 
[Page 120, Line 14] a row. “Yo u have come to Us as We created 
[Page 120, Line 15] you the first time. Although you claimed We would not set a meeting for you.”  
[Page 120, Line 16] 49. And the book will be placed, and you will 
[Page 120, Line 17] see the sinners fearful of its contents. And 
[Page 120, Line 18] they will say, “Woe to us! What is with this 
[Page 120, Line 19] book that leaves nothing, small or big, but it 
[Page 120, Line 20] has enumerated it?” They will find everything 
[Page 120, Line 21] they had done present. Your Lord does not 
[Page 120, Line 22] wrong anyone.  
[Page 120, Line 23] 50. We said to the angels, “Bow down to 
[Page 120, Line 24] Adam.” So they bowed down, except for Sa-
[Page 120, Line 25] tan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the 
[Page 120, Line 26] command of his Lord. Will you take him and 
[Page 120, Line 27] his offspring as lords instead of Me, when 
[Page 120, Line 28] they are an enemy to you? Evil is the ex-
[Page 120, Line 29] change for the wrongdoers.  
[Page 120, Line 30] 51. I did not call them to witness the creation 
[Page 120, Line 31] of the heavens and the earth, nor their own 
[Page 120, Line 32] creation; and I do not take the misleaders for 
[Page 120, Line 33] assistants.  
[Page 120, Line 34] 52. On the Day when He will say, “Call on My 
[Page 120, Line 35] partners whom you have claimed.” They will call on them, but they will not answer them. 
[Page 120, Line 36] And We will place between them a barrier.  
[Page 120, Line 37] 53. And the sinners will s ee the Fire, and will 
[Page 120, Line 38] realize that they will tumble into it. They will 
[Page 120, Line 39] find no deliverance from it.  
[Page 120, Line 40] 54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the 
[Page 120, Line 41] people every kind of example, but the human 
[Page 120, Line 42] being is a most argumentative being.  
[Page 120, Line 43] 55. What prevented people from  accepting 
[Page 120, Line 44] faith, when guidance has come to them, and from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness? Unless 
[Page 120, Line 45] they are waiting for the precedent of the an-
[Page 120, Line 46] cients to befall them, or to have the punish-
[Page 120, Line 47] ment come upon them face to face.  
[Page 120, Line 48] 56. We send the messengers only as  deliverers 
[Page 120, Line 49] of good news and warners. Those who disbe-
[Page 120, Line 50] lieve argue with false argument, in order to 
[Page 120, Line 51] defeat the truth thereby. They take My 
[Page 120, Line 52] Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.  
[Page 120, Line 53] 57. Who does greater wrong than he, who, 
[Page 120, Line 54] when reminded of his Lord’s revelations,  
[Page 120, Line 55] turns away from them, and forgets what his 
[Page 120, Line 56] hands have put forward? We have placed 
[Page 120, Line 57] coverings over their hearts, lest they under-
[Page 120, Line 58] stand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if 
[Page 120, Line 59] you call them to guidance, they will not be 
[Page 120, Line 60] guided, ever.  
[Page 120, Line 61] 58. Your Lord is the Forg iver, Possessor of 
[Page 120, Line 62] Mercy. Were He to call them to account for 
[Page 120, Line 63] what they have earned, He would have has-
[Page 120, Line 64] tened the punishment for them. But they 
[Page 120, Line 65] have an appointment from which they will 
[Page 120, Line 66] find no escape.  
[Page 120, Line 67] 59. And these towns —We destroyed them 
[Page 120, Line 68] when they committed  injustices, and We set 
[Page 120, Line 69] for their destruction an appointed time.  
[Page 120, Line 70] 60. Recall when Moses said to his servant, “I 
[Page 120, Line 71] will not give up until I reach the junction of 
[Page 120, Line 72] the two rivers, even if it takes me years.”  
[Page 120, Line 73] 61. Then, when they reached the junction be-
[Page 120, Line 74] tween them,  they forgot about their fish. It 
[Page 120, Line 75] found its way into the river, slipping away.  
[Page 120, Line 76] 62. When they went further, he said to his 
[Page 120, Line 77] servant, “Bring us our lunch; we were ex-
[Page 120, Line 78] posed in our travel to much fatigue.”  
[Page 120, Line 79] 63. He said, “Do you remember when we 
[Page 120, Line 80] rested by the rock? I forgot about the fish. It 
[Page 120, Line 81] was only the devil who made me forget it. 
[Page 120, Line 82] And so it found its way to the river, amaz-
[Page 120, Line 83] ingly.”  
[Page 120, Line 84] 64. He said, “This is what we were seeking.” 
[Page 120, Line 85] And so they turned back retracing their steps.  
[Page 120, Line 86] 65. Then they came upon a servant of O urs, 
[Page 120, Line 87] whom We had blessed with mercy from Us, 
[Page 120, Line 88] 109 
[Page 121, Line 1] 18.  THE CAVE   (al-Kahf)  
[Page 121, Line 2] and had taught him knowledge from Our 
[Page 121, Line 3] Own.  
[Page 121, Line 4] 66. Moses said to him, “May I follow you, so 
[Page 121, Line 5] that you may teach me some of the guidance 
[Page 121, Line 6] you were taught?”  
[Page 121, Line 7] 67. He said, “You will not be able to endure 
[Page 121, Line 8] with me.  
[Page 121, Line 9] 68. And how will you endure what you have no 
[Page 121, Line 10] knowledge of?”  
[Page 121, Line 11] 69. He said, “You will find me, Allah willing, 
[Page 121, Line 12] patient; and I will not disobey you in any or-der of yours.”  
[Page 121, Line 13] 70. He said, “If you follow me, do not ask me 
[Page 121, Line 14] about anything, until I myself make mention of it t o you.”  
[Page 121, Line 15] 71. So they set out. Until, when they had 
[Page 121, Line 16] boarded the boat, he holed it. He said, “Did 
[Page 121, Line 17] you hole it, to drown its passengers? You 
[Page 121, Line 18] have done something awful.”  
[Page 121, Line 19] 72. He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not 
[Page 121, Line 20] be able to endure with me?”  
[Page 121, Line 21] 73. He said,  “Do not rebuke me for forgetting, 
[Page 121, Line 22] and do not make my course difficult for me.”  
[Page 121, Line 23] 74. Then they set out. Until, when they en-
[Page 121, Line 24] countered a boy, he killed him. He said, “Did 
[Page 121, Line 25] you kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You 
[Page 121, Line 26] have done something terrible.”  
[Page 121, Line 27] 75. He said,  “Did I not tell you that you will not 
[Page 121, Line 28] be able to endure with me?”  
[Page 121, Line 29] 76. He said, “If I ask you about anything after 
[Page 121, Line 30] this, then do not keep company with me. You 
[Page 121, Line 31] have received excuses from me.”  
[Page 121, Line 32] 77. So they set out. Until, when they reached 
[Page 121, Line 33] the people of a tow n, they asked them for 
[Page 121, Line 34] food, but they refused to offer them hospital-
[Page 121, Line 35] ity. There they found a wall about to collapse, 
[Page 121, Line 36] and he repaired it. He said, “If you wanted, 
[Page 121, Line 37] you could have obtained a payment for it.”  
[Page 121, Line 38] 78. He said, “This is the parting between you 
[Page 121, Line 39] and me . I will tell you the interpretation of 
[Page 121, Line 40] what you were unable to endure.  
[Page 121, Line 41] 79. As for the boat, it belonged to paupers 
[Page 121, Line 42] working at sea. I wanted to damage it because there was a king coming after them seizing 
[Page 121, Line 43] every boat by force.  
[Page 121, Line 44] 80. As for the boy, his parent s were believers, 
[Page 121, Line 45] and we feared he would overwhelm them 
[Page 121, Line 46] with oppression and disbelief.  
[Page 121, Line 47] 81. So we wanted their Lord to replace him 
[Page 121, Line 48] with someone better in purity, and closer to 
[Page 121, Line 49] mercy.  
[Page 121, Line 50] 82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two or-
[Page 121, Line 51] phaned boys in the town. Beneath it was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father 
[Page 121, Line 52] was a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them 
[Page 121, Line 53] to reach their maturity, and then extract their 
[Page 121, Line 54] treasure —as a mercy from your Lord. I did 
[Page 121, Line 55] not do it of my own accord. This is the inter-
[Page 121, Line 56] pretation of what y ou were unable to en-
[Page 121, Line 57] dure.”  
[Page 121, Line 58] 83. And they ask you about Zul -Qarnain. Say, 
[Page 121, Line 59] “I will tell you something about him.”  
[Page 121, Line 60] 84. We established him on earth, and gave him 
[Page 121, Line 61] all kinds of means.  
[Page 121, Line 62] 85. He pursued a certain course.  
[Page 121, Line 63] 86. Until, when he reached the setting of the 
[Page 121, Line 64] sun, he found it setting in a murky spring, 
[Page 121, Line 65] and found a people in its vicinity. We said, “O 
[Page 121, Line 66] Zul-Qarnain, you may either inflict a penalty, 
[Page 121, Line 67] or else treat them kindly.”  
[Page 121, Line 68] 87. He said, “As for him who does wrong, we 
[Page 121, Line 69] will penalize him, then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with an un-
[Page 121, Line 70] heard -of torment.  
[Page 121, Line 71] 88. “But as for him who believes and acts right-
[Page 121, Line 72] eously, he will have the finest reward, and We 
[Page 121, Line 73] will speak to him of Our command with 
[Page 121, Line 74] ease.”  
[Page 121, Line 75] 89. Then he pursued a course.  
[Page 121, Line 76] 90. Until, when he reac hed the rising of the 
[Page 121, Line 77] sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it.  
[Page 121, Line 78] 91. And so it was. We had full knowledge of 
[Page 121, Line 79] what he had.  
[Page 121, Line 80] 92. Then he pursued a course.  
[Page 121, Line 81] 93. Until, when he reached the point separat-
[Page 121, Line 82] ing the two barriers, he found beside them a 
[Page 121, Line 83] 110 
[Page 122, Line 1] 19.  MARY   (Maryam)  
[Page 122, Line 2] people who could barely understand what is 
[Page 122, Line 3] said.  
[Page 122, Line 4] 94. They said, “O Zul -Qarnain, the Gog and 
[Page 122, Line 5] Magog are spreading chaos in the land. Can 
[Page 122, Line 6] we pay you, to build between us and them a 
[Page 122, Line 7] wall?”  
[Page 122, Line 8] 95. He said, “What my Lord has empowered 
[Page 122, Line 9] me with  is better. But assist me with strength, 
[Page 122, Line 10] and I will build between you and them a dam.”  
[Page 122, Line 11] 96. “Bring me blocks of iron.” So that, when he 
[Page 122, Line 12] had leveled up between the two cliffs, he said, 
[Page 122, Line 13] “Blow.” And having turned it into a fire, he 
[Page 122, Line 14] said, “Bring me tar to pour over it.”  
[Page 122, Line 15] 97. So they were unable to climb it, and they 
[Page 122, Line 16] could not penetrate it.  
[Page 122, Line 17] 98. He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. 
[Page 122, Line 18] But when the promise of my Lord comes true, 
[Page 122, Line 19] He will turn it into rubble, and the promise 
[Page 122, Line 20] of my Lord is always true.”  
[Page 122, Line 21] 99. On that Day , We will leave them surging 
[Page 122, Line 22] upon one another. And the Trumpet will be 
[Page 122, Line 23] blown, and We will gather them together.  
[Page 122, Line 24] 100. On that Day, We will present the disbe-
[Page 122, Line 25] lievers to Hell, all displayed.  
[Page 122, Line 26] 101. Those whose eyes were screened to My 
[Page 122, Line 27] message, and were unable to  hear.  
[Page 122, Line 28] 102. Do those who disbelieve think that they 
[Page 122, Line 29] can take My servants for masters instead of 
[Page 122, Line 30] Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospital-
[Page 122, Line 31] ity of the faithless.  
[Page 122, Line 32] 103. Say, “Shall We inform you of the greatest 
[Page 122, Line 33] losers in their works?”  
[Page 122, Line 34] 104. “Those whose efforts  in this world are 
[Page 122, Line 35] misguided, while they assume that they are doing well.”  
[Page 122, Line 36] 105. It is they who rejected the communica-
[Page 122, Line 37] tions of their Lord, and the encounter with 
[Page 122, Line 38] Him. So their works are in vain. And on the 
[Page 122, Line 39] Day of Resurrection, We will consider them 
[Page 122, Line 40] of no we ight.  
[Page 122, Line 41] 106. That is their requital —Hell —on account 
[Page 122, Line 42] of their disbelief, and their taking My revela-
[Page 122, Line 43] tions and My messengers in mockery.  107. As for those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 122, Line 44] deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise 
[Page 122, Line 45] for hospitality.  
[Page 122, Line 46] 108. Abiding t herein forever, without desiring 
[Page 122, Line 47] any change therefrom.  
[Page 122, Line 48] 109. Say, “If the ocean were ink for the words 
[Page 122, Line 49] of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before 
[Page 122, Line 50] the words of my Lord run out,” even if We 
[Page 122, Line 51] were to bring the like of it in addition to it.  
[Page 122, Line 52] 110. Say, “I am only  a human being like you, 
[Page 122, Line 53] being inspired that your god is One God. 
[Page 122, Line 54] Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him 
[Page 122, Line 55] work righteousness, and never associate any-
[Page 122, Line 56] one with the service of his Lord.”  

[Page 122, Line 58] 19. MARY  
[Page 122, Line 59] (Maryam)  
[Page 122, Line 60] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 122, Line 61] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 122, Line 62] 1. Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad.  
[Page 122, Line 63] 2. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to-
[Page 122, Line 64] wards His servant Zechariah.  
[Page 122, Line 65] 3. When he called on his Lord, a call in seclu-
[Page 122, Line 66] sion.  
[Page 122, Line 67] 4. He said, “My Lord, my bones have become 
[Page 122, Line 68] feeble, and my hair is aflame with gray, and 
[Page 122, Line 69] never, Lord, have I be en disappointed in my 
[Page 122, Line 70] prayer to you.  
[Page 122, Line 71] 5. “And I fear for my dependents after me, and 
[Page 122, Line 72] my wife is barren. So grant me, from Your-
[Page 122, Line 73] self, an heir.  
[Page 122, Line 74] 6. To inherit me, and inherit from the House 
[Page 122, Line 75] of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”  
[Page 122, Line 76] 7. “O Zechariah, We give yo u good news of a 
[Page 122, Line 77] son, whose name is John, a name We have never given before.”  
[Page 122, Line 78] 8. He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son, 
[Page 122, Line 79] when my wife is barren, and I have become 
[Page 122, Line 80] decrepit with old age?”  
[Page 122, Line 81] 9. He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is 
[Page 122, Line 82] easy for me, and I created you before, when 
[Page 122, Line 83] you were nothing.’”  
[Page 122, Line 84] 111 
[Page 123, Line 1] 19.  MARY   (Maryam)  
[Page 123, Line 2] 10. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, 
[Page 123, Line 3] “Your sign is that you will not speak to the 
[Page 123, Line 4] people for three nights straight.”  
[Page 123, Line 5] 11. And he came out to his people, from the 
[Page 123, Line 6] sanctuary, and signaled to them to p raise 
[Page 123, Line 7] morning and evening.  
[Page 123, Line 8] 12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,” 
[Page 123, Line 9] and We gave him wisdom in his youth.  
[Page 123, Line 10] 13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence. 
[Page 123, Line 11] He was devout.  
[Page 123, Line 12] 14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a 
[Page 123, Line 13] disobedient tyrant.  
[Page 123, Line 14] 15. And peace be upon  him the day he was 
[Page 123, Line 15] born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is 
[Page 123, Line 16] raised alive.  
[Page 123, Line 17] 16. And mention in the Scripture Mary, when 
[Page 123, Line 18] she withdrew from her people to an eastern 
[Page 123, Line 19] location.  
[Page 123, Line 20] 17. She screened herself away from them, and 
[Page 123, Line 21] We sent to her Our spirit, and He a ppeared 
[Page 123, Line 22] to her as an immaculate human.  
[Page 123, Line 23] 18. She said, “I take refuge from you in the 
[Page 123, Line 24] Most Merciful, should you be righteous.”  
[Page 123, Line 25] 19. He said, “I am only the messenger of your 
[Page 123, Line 26] Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”  
[Page 123, Line 27] 20. She said, “How can I have a son, when no 
[Page 123, Line 28] man has touched me, and I was never un-chaste?”  
[Page 123, Line 29] 21. He said, “Thus said your Lord, `It is easy 
[Page 123, Line 30] for Me, and We will make him a sign for hu-manity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter 
[Page 123, Line 31] already decided.'“  
[Page 123, Line 32] 22. So she carried him, and secluded herself 
[Page 123, Line 33] with him in a remote place.  
[Page 123, Line 34] 23. The labor -pains came upon her, by the 
[Page 123, Line 35] trunk of a palm -tree. She said, “I wish I had 
[Page 123, Line 36] died before this, and been completely forgot-
[Page 123, Line 37] ten.”  
[Page 123, Line 38] 24. Whereupon he called her from beneath 
[Page 123, Line 39] her: “Do not worry; your Lord has placed a 
[Page 123, Line 40] stream beneath you.  
[Page 123, Line 41] 25. And shake the trunk of the palm -tree to-
[Page 123, Line 42] wards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you.”  26. “So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if 
[Page 123, Line 43] you see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast 
[Page 123, Line 44] to the Most Gracious, so I will not speak to 
[Page 123, Line 45] any human today.'“  
[Page 123, Line 46] 27. Then she came to her people, carrying him. 
[Page 123, Line 47] They said, “O Mary, you have done some-
[Page 123, Line 48] thing terrible.  
[Page 123, Line 49] 28. O sister of Aaron, your father was not an 
[Page 123, Line 50] evil man, and your mother was not a whore.”  
[Page 123, Line 51] 29. So she pointed to him. They said, “How 
[Page 123, Line 52] can we speak to an infant  in the crib?”  
[Page 123, Line 53] 30. He said, “I am the servant of Allah. He has 
[Page 123, Line 54] given me the Scripture, and made me a 
[Page 123, Line 55] prophet.  
[Page 123, Line 56] 31. And has made me blessed wherever I may 
[Page 123, Line 57] be; and has enjoined on me prayer and char-
[Page 123, Line 58] ity, so long as I live.  
[Page 123, Line 59] 32. And kind to my mother, and He did not 
[Page 123, Line 60] make me a disobedient rebel.  
[Page 123, Line 61] 33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born, 
[Page 123, Line 62] and the day I die, and the Day I get resur-rected alive.”  
[Page 123, Line 63] 34. That is Jesus son of Mary —the Word of 
[Page 123, Line 64] truth about which they doubt.  
[Page 123, Line 65] 35. It is not for Allah to have a child —glory be 
[Page 123, Line 66] to Him. To have anything done, He says to it, “Be,” and it becomes.  
[Page 123, Line 67] 36. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-
[Page 123, Line 68] ship Him. That is a straight path.”  
[Page 123, Line 69] 37. But the various factions differed among 
[Page 123, Line 70] themselves. So woe to those who disbelieve from the scene of a tr emendous Day.  
[Page 123, Line 71] 38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day 
[Page 123, Line 72] they come to Us. But the wrongdoers today 
[Page 123, Line 73] are completely lost.  
[Page 123, Line 74] 39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when 
[Page 123, Line 75] the matter will be concluded. Yet they are 
[Page 123, Line 76] heedless, and they do not believe.  
[Page 123, Line 77] 40. It is We who will inherit the earth and eve-
[Page 123, Line 78] ryone on it, and to Us they will be returned.  
[Page 123, Line 79] 41. And mention in the Scripture Abraham. 
[Page 123, Line 80] He was a man of truth, a prophet.  
[Page 123, Line 81] 112 
[Page 124, Line 1] 19.  MARY   (Maryam)  
[Page 124, Line 2] 42. He said to his father, “O my father, why do 
[Page 124, Line 3] you worship what can neither hear, nor see, 
[Page 124, Line 4] nor b enefit you in any way?  
[Page 124, Line 5] 43. O my father, there has come to me 
[Page 124, Line 6] knowledge that never came to you. So follow 
[Page 124, Line 7] me, and I will guide you along a straight way.  
[Page 124, Line 8] 44. O my father, do not worship the devil. The 
[Page 124, Line 9] devil is disobedient to the Most Gracious.  
[Page 124, Line 10] 45. O my fathe r, I fear that a punishment from 
[Page 124, Line 11] the Most Gracious will afflict you, and you 
[Page 124, Line 12] become an ally of the devil.”  
[Page 124, Line 13] 46. He said, “Are you renouncing my gods, O 
[Page 124, Line 14] Abraham? If you do not desist, I will stone you. So leave me alone for a while.”  
[Page 124, Line 15] 47. He said, “Peace be u pon you. I will ask my 
[Page 124, Line 16] Lord to forgive you; He has been Kind to me.  
[Page 124, Line 17] 48. And I will withdraw from you, and from 
[Page 124, Line 18] what you pray to instead of Allah. And I will 
[Page 124, Line 19] pray to my Lord, and I hope I will not be dis-
[Page 124, Line 20] appointed in my prayer to my Lord.”  
[Page 124, Line 21] 49. When he withdr ew from them, and from 
[Page 124, Line 22] what they worship besides Allah, We granted 
[Page 124, Line 23] him Isaac and Jacob. And each We made a 
[Page 124, Line 24] prophet.  
[Page 124, Line 25] 50. And We gave them freely of Our mercy, 
[Page 124, Line 26] and gave them a noble reputation of truth.  
[Page 124, Line 27] 51. And mention in the Scripture Moses. He 
[Page 124, Line 28] was dedicate d. He was a messenger and a 
[Page 124, Line 29] prophet.  
[Page 124, Line 30] 52. And We called him from the right side of 
[Page 124, Line 31] the Mount, and brought him near in com-munion.  
[Page 124, Line 32] 53. And We granted him, out of Our mercy, 
[Page 124, Line 33] his brother Aaron, a prophet.  
[Page 124, Line 34] 54. And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He 
[Page 124, Line 35] was true to  his promise, and was a messenger, 
[Page 124, Line 36] a prophet.  
[Page 124, Line 37] 55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer 
[Page 124, Line 38] and charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.  
[Page 124, Line 39] 56. And mention in the Scripture Enoch. He 
[Page 124, Line 40] was a man of truth, a prophet.  
[Page 124, Line 41] 57. And We raised him to a high position.  58. These are some of the prophets Allah has 
[Page 124, Line 42] blessed, from the descendants of Adam, and 
[Page 124, Line 43] from those We carried with Noah, and from 
[Page 124, Line 44] the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and 
[Page 124, Line 45] from those We guided and selected. When-
[Page 124, Line 46] ever the revelations of the Most Gracious ar e 
[Page 124, Line 47] recited to them, they would fall down, pros-
[Page 124, Line 48] trating and weeping.  
[Page 124, Line 49] 59. But they were succeeded by generations 
[Page 124, Line 50] who lost the prayers and followed their appe-
[Page 124, Line 51] tites. They will meet perdition.  
[Page 124, Line 52] 60. Except for those who repent, and believe, 
[Page 124, Line 53] and act righteously. The se will enter Paradise, 
[Page 124, Line 54] and will not be wronged in the least.  
[Page 124, Line 55] 61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the 
[Page 124, Line 56] Most Merciful to His servants in the Unseen. 
[Page 124, Line 57] His promise will certainly come true.  
[Page 124, Line 58] 62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but 
[Page 124, Line 59] only peace. And they will have their provision 
[Page 124, Line 60] therein, morning and evening.  
[Page 124, Line 61] 63. Such is Paradise which We will give as in-
[Page 124, Line 62] heritance to those of Our servants who are 
[Page 124, Line 63] devout.  
[Page 124, Line 64] 64. “We do not descend except by the com-
[Page 124, Line 65] mand of your Lord. His is what is before us, and what is behind us, and what is between 
[Page 124, Line 66] them. Your Lord is never forgetful.”  
[Page 124, Line 67] 65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what 
[Page 124, Line 68] is between them. So worship Him, and perse-vere in His service. Do you know of anyone 
[Page 124, Line 69] equal to Him?  
[Page 124, Line 70] 66. And the human being says, “When I am 
[Page 124, Line 71] dead, will I be brought back alive?”  
[Page 124, Line 72] 67. Does the human being not remember that 
[Page 124, Line 73] We created him before, when he was noth-ing? 
[Page 124, Line 74] 68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and 
[Page 124, Line 75] the devils, then We will bring them around 
[Page 124, Line 76] Hell, on their knees.  
[Page 124, Line 77] 69. Then, out of every sect, We wil l snatch 
[Page 124, Line 78] those most defiant to the Most Merciful.  
[Page 124, Line 79] 70. We are fully aware of those most deserving 
[Page 124, Line 80] to scorch in it.  
[Page 124, Line 81] 113 
[Page 125, Line 1] 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 125, Line 2] 71. There is not one of you but will go down to 
[Page 125, Line 3] it. This has been an unavoidable decree of 
[Page 125, Line 4] your Lord.  
[Page 125, Line 5] 72. Then We will rescue those who were d e-
[Page 125, Line 6] vout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their 
[Page 125, Line 7] knees.  
[Page 125, Line 8] 73. When Our clear revelations are recited to 
[Page 125, Line 9] them, those who disbelieve say to those who 
[Page 125, Line 10] believe, “Which of the two parties is better in 
[Page 125, Line 11] position, and superior in influence?”  
[Page 125, Line 12] 74. How many a generation  have We de-
[Page 125, Line 13] stroyed before them, who surpassed them in riches and splendor?  
[Page 125, Line 14] 75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merci-
[Page 125, Line 15] ful will lead him on.” Until, when they see 
[Page 125, Line 16] what they were promised —either the punish-
[Page 125, Line 17] ment, or the Hour. Then they will know who 
[Page 125, Line 18] was in w orse position and weaker in forces.  
[Page 125, Line 19] 76. Allah increases in guidance those who ac-
[Page 125, Line 20] cept guidance. And the things that endure —
[Page 125, Line 21] the righteous deeds —have the best reward 
[Page 125, Line 22] with your Lord, and the best outcome.  
[Page 125, Line 23] 77. Have you seen him who denied Our reve-
[Page 125, Line 24] lations, and said, “I will be given wealth and 
[Page 125, Line 25] children”?  
[Page 125, Line 26] 78. Did he look into the future, or did he re-
[Page 125, Line 27] ceive a promise from the Most Merciful?  
[Page 125, Line 28] 79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and 
[Page 125, Line 29] will keep extending the agony for him.  
[Page 125, Line 30] 80. Then We will inherit from him what h e 
[Page 125, Line 31] speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.  
[Page 125, Line 32] 81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods, 
[Page 125, Line 33] to be for them a source of strength.  
[Page 125, Line 34] 82. By no means! They will reject their worship 
[Page 125, Line 35] of them, and become opponents to them.  
[Page 125, Line 36] 83. Have you not considered how We dispatch  
[Page 125, Line 37] the devils against the disbelievers, exciting them with incitement?  
[Page 125, Line 38] 84. So do not hurry against them. We are 
[Page 125, Line 39] counting for them a countdown.  
[Page 125, Line 40] 85. On the Day when We will gather the right-
[Page 125, Line 41] eous to the Most Merciful, as guests.  
[Page 125, Line 42] 86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals 
[Page 125, Line 43] to water.  87. They will have no power of intercession, 
[Page 125, Line 44] except for someone who has an agreement 
[Page 125, Line 45] with the Most Merciful.  
[Page 125, Line 46] 88. And they say, “The Most Merciful has be-
[Page 125, Line 47] gotten a son.”  
[Page 125, Line 48] 89. You have come up with something mon-
[Page 125, Line 49] strous.  
[Page 125, Line 50] 90. At which the heavens almost rupture, and 
[Page 125, Line 51] the earth splits, and the mountains fall and 
[Page 125, Line 52] crumble.  
[Page 125, Line 53] 91. Because they attribute a son to the Most 
[Page 125, Line 54] Merciful.  
[Page 125, Line 55] 92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to 
[Page 125, Line 56] have a son.  
[Page 125, Line 57] 93. There is none in the heavens and the earth 
[Page 125, Line 58] but will come to the Most Merciful as a serv-
[Page 125, Line 59] ant. 
[Page 125, Line 60] 94. He has enumerated them, and counted 
[Page 125, Line 61] them one by one.  
[Page 125, Line 62] 95. And each one of them will come to Him on 
[Page 125, Line 63] the Day of Resurrection alone.  
[Page 125, Line 64] 96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds, 
[Page 125, Line 65] the Most Merciful will give them lov e. 
[Page 125, Line 66] 97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order 
[Page 125, Line 67] to deliver good news to the righteous, and to warn with it a hostile people.  
[Page 125, Line 68] 98. How many a generation have We de-
[Page 125, Line 69] stroyed before them? Can you feel a single 
[Page 125, Line 70] one of them, or hear from them the slightest 
[Page 125, Line 71] whisper ? 

[Page 125, Line 73] 20. TA-HA 
[Page 125, Line 74] (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 125, Line 75] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 125, Line 76] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 125, Line 77] 1. Ta, Ha.  
[Page 125, Line 78] 2. We did not reveal the Quran to you to make 
[Page 125, Line 79] you suffer.  
[Page 125, Line 80] 3. But only as a reminder for him who fears.  
[Page 125, Line 81] 4. A revelation from He who created the earth 
[Page 125, Line 82] and the high heavens.  
[Page 125, Line 83] 114 
[Page 126, Line 1] 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 126, Line 2] 5. The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set-
[Page 126, Line 3] tled.  
[Page 126, Line 4] 6. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
[Page 126, Line 5] and the earth, and everything between them, 
[Page 126, Line 6] and everything beneath the soil.  
[Page 126, Line 7] 7. If you speak aloud —He knows the secret, 
[Page 126, Line 8] and the most hidden.  
[Page 126, Line 9] 8. Allah, there is no god but He, His are the 
[Page 126, Line 10] Most Beautiful Names.  
[Page 126, Line 11] 9. Has the story of Moses reached you?  
[Page 126, Line 12] 10. When he saw a fire, he said to his family, 
[Page 126, Line 13] “Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can 
[Page 126, Line 14] bring you a torch therefrom, or find some 
[Page 126, Line 15] guidance by the fire.”  
[Page 126, Line 16] 11. Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O 
[Page 126, Line 17] Moses.  
[Page 126, Line 18] 12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. 
[Page 126, Line 19] You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.  
[Page 126, Line 20] 13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re-
[Page 126, Line 21] vealed.  
[Page 126, Line 22] 14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So 
[Page 126, Line 23] serve Me, and p ractice the prayer for My re-
[Page 126, Line 24] membrance.  
[Page 126, Line 25] 15. The Hour is coming —but I keep it almost 
[Page 126, Line 26] hidden —so that each soul will be paid for 
[Page 126, Line 27] what it endeavors.  
[Page 126, Line 28] 16. And do not let him who denies it and fol-
[Page 126, Line 29] lows his desire turn you away from it, lest you 
[Page 126, Line 30] fall. 
[Page 126, Line 31] 17. And what i s that in your right -hand, O Mo-
[Page 126, Line 32] ses?”  
[Page 126, Line 33] 18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and 
[Page 126, Line 34] herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses for it.”  
[Page 126, Line 35] 19. He said, “Throw it, O Moses.”  
[Page 126, Line 36] 20. So he threw it— thereupon it became a 
[Page 126, Line 37] moving serpent.  
[Page 126, Line 38] 21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear. 
[Page 126, Line 39] We will restore it to its original condition.  
[Page 126, Line 40] 22. And press your hand to your side; it will 
[Page 126, Line 41] come out white, without a blemish— another 
[Page 126, Line 42] sign.  23. That We may show you some of Our great-
[Page 126, Line 43] est signs.  
[Page 126, Line 44] 24. Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed. ” 
[Page 126, Line 45] 25. He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace 
[Page 126, Line 46] for me.  
[Page 126, Line 47] 26. And ease my task for me.  
[Page 126, Line 48] 27. And untie the knot from my tongue.  
[Page 126, Line 49] 28. So they can understand my speech.  
[Page 126, Line 50] 29. And appoint an assistant for me, from my 
[Page 126, Line 51] family.  
[Page 126, Line 52] 30. Aaron, my brother.  
[Page 126, Line 53] 31. Strengthen me with him.  
[Page 126, Line 54] 32. And have him share in my mission.  
[Page 126, Line 55] 33. That we may glorify You much.  
[Page 126, Line 56] 34. And remember You much.  
[Page 126, Line 57] 35. You are always watching over us.”  
[Page 126, Line 58] 36. He said, “You are granted your request, O 
[Page 126, Line 59] Moses.  
[Page 126, Line 60] 37. We had favored you another time.  
[Page 126, Line 61] 38. When We inspired your mother with the 
[Page 126, Line 62] inspiration.  
[Page 126, Line 63] 39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into 
[Page 126, Line 64] the river. The river will wash him to shore, where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his 
[Page 126, Line 65] will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon 
[Page 126, Line 66] you love from Me, so that you may be  reared 
[Page 126, Line 67] before My eye.  
[Page 126, Line 68] 40. When your sister walked along, and said, 
[Page 126, Line 69] ‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take care of him?' So We returned you to your mother, that she may be comforted, and not 
[Page 126, Line 70] sorrow. And you killed a person, but We 
[Page 126, Line 71] saved you from str ess; and We tested you 
[Page 126, Line 72] thoroughly. And you stayed years among the 
[Page 126, Line 73] people of Median. Then you came back, as 
[Page 126, Line 74] ordained, O Moses.  
[Page 126, Line 75] 41. And I made you for Myself.  
[Page 126, Line 76] 42. Go, you and your brother, with My signs, 
[Page 126, Line 77] and do not neglect My remembrance.  
[Page 126, Line 78] 43. Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.  
[Page 126, Line 79] 115 
[Page 127, Line 1] 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 127, Line 2] 44. But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will re-
[Page 127, Line 3] member, or have some fear.”  
[Page 127, Line 4] 45. They said, “Lord, we fear he may persecute 
[Page 127, Line 5] us, or become violent.”  
[Page 127, Line 6] 46. He said, “Do not fear, I am with you, I hear 
[Page 127, Line 7] and I see.  
[Page 127, Line 8] 47. Approach him and say, `We a re the mes-
[Page 127, Line 9] sengers of your Lord; so let the Children of 
[Page 127, Line 10] Israel go with us, and do not torment them. 
[Page 127, Line 11] We bring you a sign from your Lord, and 
[Page 127, Line 12] peace be upon him who follows guidance.  
[Page 127, Line 13] 48. It was revealed to us that the punishment 
[Page 127, Line 14] falls upon him who disbelieves and turns 
[Page 127, Line 15] away.'“  
[Page 127, Line 16] 49. He said, “Who is your Lord, O Moses.”  
[Page 127, Line 17] 50. He said, “Our Lord is He who gave every-
[Page 127, Line 18] thing its existence, then guided it.” 
[Page 127, Line 19] 51. He said, “What about the first genera-
[Page 127, Line 20] tions?”  
[Page 127, Line 21] 52. He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my 
[Page 127, Line 22] Lord, in a Book. My Lor d never errs, nor does 
[Page 127, Line 23] He forget.”  
[Page 127, Line 24] 53. He who made the earth a habitat for you; 
[Page 127, Line 25] and traced in it routes for you; and sent down 
[Page 127, Line 26] water from the sky, with which We produce 
[Page 127, Line 27] pairs of diverse plants.  
[Page 127, Line 28] 54. Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are 
[Page 127, Line 29] signs for thos e with understanding.  
[Page 127, Line 30] 55. From it We created you, and into it We will 
[Page 127, Line 31] return you, and from it We will bring you out 
[Page 127, Line 32] another time.  
[Page 127, Line 33] 56. We showed him Our signs, all of them, but 
[Page 127, Line 34] he denied and refused.  
[Page 127, Line 35] 57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us 
[Page 127, Line 36] out of our land with your magic, O Moses?  
[Page 127, Line 37] 58. We will produce for you magic like it; so 
[Page 127, Line 38] make an appointment between us and you, 
[Page 127, Line 39] which we will not miss —neither us, nor 
[Page 127, Line 40] you—in a central place.”  
[Page 127, Line 41] 59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of 
[Page 127, Line 42] the festival, so let the peopl e be gathered to-
[Page 127, Line 43] gether at mid -morning.”  60. Pharaoh turned away, put together his 
[Page 127, Line 44] plan, and then came back.  
[Page 127, Line 45] 61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not 
[Page 127, Line 46] fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy 
[Page 127, Line 47] you with a punishment. He who invents lies 
[Page 127, Line 48] will fail.”  
[Page 127, Line 49] 62. They disagreed among themselves over 
[Page 127, Line 50] their affair, and conferred secretly.  
[Page 127, Line 51] 63. They said, “These two are magicians who 
[Page 127, Line 52] want to drive you out of your land with their 
[Page 127, Line 53] magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of 
[Page 127, Line 54] life. 
[Page 127, Line 55] 64. So settle your plan, and come as one front. 
[Page 127, Line 56] Today, whoever gains the upper hand will 
[Page 127, Line 57] succeed.”  
[Page 127, Line 58] 65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or 
[Page 127, Line 59] we will be the first to throw.”  
[Page 127, Line 60] 66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their 
[Page 127, Line 61] ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of their magic, to be crawli ng swiftly.  
[Page 127, Line 62] 67. So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.  
[Page 127, Line 63] 68. We said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up-
[Page 127, Line 64] permost.  
[Page 127, Line 65] 69. Now throw down what is in your right 
[Page 127, Line 66] hand —it will swallow what they have crafted. 
[Page 127, Line 67] What they have crafted is only a magician’s 
[Page 127, Line 68] trickery. Bu t the magician will not succeed, 
[Page 127, Line 69] no matter what he does.”  
[Page 127, Line 70] 70. And the magicians fell down prostrate. 
[Page 127, Line 71] They said, “We have believed in the Lord of 
[Page 127, Line 72] Aaron and Moses.”  
[Page 127, Line 73] 71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I 
[Page 127, Line 74] have given you permission? He must be your chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off 
[Page 127, Line 75] your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the 
[Page 127, Line 76] palm -trees. Then you will know which of us 
[Page 127, Line 77] is more severe in punishment, and more last-
[Page 127, Line 78] ing.”  
[Page 127, Line 79] 72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the 
[Page 127, Line 80] proofs that have come to us, and Him who 
[Page 127, Line 81] created us. So issue whatever judgment you 
[Page 127, Line 82] wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly 
[Page 127, Line 83] life. 
[Page 127, Line 84] 116 
[Page 128, Line 1] 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 128, Line 2] 73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He 
[Page 128, Line 3] may forgive us our sins, and the magic you 
[Page 128, Line 4] have compelled u s to practice. Allah is Better, 
[Page 128, Line 5] and more Lasting.”  
[Page 128, Line 6] 74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him 
[Page 128, Line 7] is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.  
[Page 128, Line 8] 75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, hav-
[Page 128, Line 9] ing worked righteousness —these will have 
[Page 128, Line 10] the highest ranks.  
[Page 128, Line 11] 76. The Garde ns of Perpetuity, beneath which 
[Page 128, Line 12] rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is 
[Page 128, Line 13] the reward for him who purifies himself.  
[Page 128, Line 14] 77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night 
[Page 128, Line 15] with My servants, and strike for them a dry path across the sea, not fearing being over-
[Page 128, Line 16] taken, nor worrying.”  
[Page 128, Line 17] 78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but 
[Page 128, Line 18] the sea overwhelmed them, and completely 
[Page 128, Line 19] engulfed them.  
[Page 128, Line 20] 79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not 
[Page 128, Line 21] guide them.  
[Page 128, Line 22] 80. O Children of Israel! We have delivered 
[Page 128, Line 23] you from your enemy, and promised you by 
[Page 128, Line 24] the right side of the Mount, and sent down to 
[Page 128, Line 25] you manna and quails.  
[Page 128, Line 26] 81. Eat of the good things We have provided 
[Page 128, Line 27] for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest My wrath descends upon you. He upon 
[Page 128, Line 28] whom My wrath descends has fallen.  
[Page 128, Line 29] 82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re-
[Page 128, Line 30] pents, believes, acts righteously, and then re-
[Page 128, Line 31] mains guided.  
[Page 128, Line 32] 83. “And what made you rush ahead of your 
[Page 128, Line 33] people, O Moses?”  
[Page 128, Line 34] 84. He said, “They are following in my foot-
[Page 128, Line 35] steps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that you may be pleased.”  
[Page 128, Line 36] 85. He s aid, “We have tested your people in 
[Page 128, Line 37] your absence, and the Samarian misled 
[Page 128, Line 38] them.”  
[Page 128, Line 39] 86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and 
[Page 128, Line 40] disappointed. He said, “O my people, did 
[Page 128, Line 41] your Lord not promise you a good promise? 
[Page 128, Line 42] Was the time too long for you? Or did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon 
[Page 128, Line 43] you, so you broke your promise to me?”  
[Page 128, Line 44] 87. They said, “We did not break our promise 
[Page 128, Line 45] to you by our choice, but we were made to 
[Page 128, Line 46] carry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we 
[Page 128, Line 47] cast them in. That was what the Samarian sugg ested.”  
[Page 128, Line 48] 88. So he produced for them a calf —a mere 
[Page 128, Line 49] body which lowed. And they said, “This is 
[Page 128, Line 50] your god, and the god of Moses, but he has 
[Page 128, Line 51] forgotten.”  
[Page 128, Line 52] 89. Did they not see that it cannot return a 
[Page 128, Line 53] word to them, and has no power to harm 
[Page 128, Line 54] them or benefit them?  
[Page 128, Line 55] 90. Aaron had said to them before, “O my peo-
[Page 128, Line 56] ple, you are being tested by this. And your 
[Page 128, Line 57] Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey 
[Page 128, Line 58] my command.”  
[Page 128, Line 59] 91. They said, “We will not give up our devo-
[Page 128, Line 60] tion to it, until Moses returns to us.”  
[Page 128, Line 61] 92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, 
[Page 128, Line 62] when you saw them going astray.  
[Page 128, Line 63] 93. From following me? Did you disobey my 
[Page 128, Line 64] command?”  
[Page 128, Line 65] 94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize 
[Page 128, Line 66] me by my beard or my head. I feared you 
[Page 128, Line 67] would say, `You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and d id not regard my 
[Page 128, Line 68] word.'“  
[Page 128, Line 69] 95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Sa-
[Page 128, Line 70] marian?”  
[Page 128, Line 71] 96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I 
[Page 128, Line 72] grasped a handful from the Messenger’s 
[Page 128, Line 73] traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul 
[Page 128, Line 74] prompted me.”  
[Page 128, Line 75] 97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in th is life is to 
[Page 128, Line 76] say, ‘No contact.’ And you have an appoint-
[Page 128, Line 77] ment that you will not miss. Now look at your 
[Page 128, Line 78] god that you remained devoted to— we will 
[Page 128, Line 79] burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea, as powder.”  
[Page 128, Line 80] 98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides 
[Page 128, Line 81] whom there is no other god. He compre-
[Page 128, Line 82] hends everything in knowledge.  
[Page 128, Line 83] 117 
[Page 129, Line 1] 20.  TA-HA  (Ta-Ha) 
[Page 129, Line 2] 99. Thus We narrate to you reports of times 
[Page 129, Line 3] gone by; and We have given you a message 
[Page 129, Line 4] from Our Presence.  
[Page 129, Line 5] 100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on 
[Page 129, Line 6] the Day of Resurrection a burden.  
[Page 129, Line 7] 101. Abidi ng therein forever. And wretched is 
[Page 129, Line 8] their burden on the Day of Resurrection.  
[Page 129, Line 9] 102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown —
[Page 129, Line 10] We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.  
[Page 129, Line 11] 103. Murmuring among themselves: “You have 
[Page 129, Line 12] lingered only for ten.”  
[Page 129, Line 13] 104. We are fully aware of what they say, when 
[Page 129, Line 14] the most exemplary of them in conduct will 
[Page 129, Line 15] say, “You have lingered only a day.”  
[Page 129, Line 16] 105. And they ask you about the mountains. 
[Page 129, Line 17] Say, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”  
[Page 129, Line 18] 106. And leave them desolate waste.  
[Page 129, Line 19] 107. You will see in them neithe r crookedness, 
[Page 129, Line 20] nor deviation.”  
[Page 129, Line 21] 108. On that Day, they will follow the caller, 
[Page 129, Line 22] without any deviation. Voices will be hushed 
[Page 129, Line 23] before the Merciful, and you will hear noth-
[Page 129, Line 24] ing but murmur.   
[Page 129, Line 25] 109. On that Day, intercession will not avail, 
[Page 129, Line 26] except for him permitted by the Merciful, and 
[Page 129, Line 27] whose words He has approved.  
[Page 129, Line 28] 110. He knows what is before them and what is 
[Page 129, Line 29] behind them, and they cannot comprehend 
[Page 129, Line 30] Him in their knowledge.  
[Page 129, Line 31] 111. Faces will be humbled before the Living, 
[Page 129, Line 32] the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will 
[Page 129, Line 33] despai r. 
[Page 129, Line 34] 112. But whoever has done righteous deeds, 
[Page 129, Line 35] while being a believer —will fear neither in-
[Page 129, Line 36] justice, nor grievance.  
[Page 129, Line 37] 113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic 
[Page 129, Line 38] Quran, and We have diversified the warnings 
[Page 129, Line 39] in it, that perhaps they would become right-
[Page 129, Line 40] eous, or it may produce a lesson for them.  
[Page 129, Line 41] 114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be 
[Page 129, Line 42] hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to 
[Page 129, Line 43] you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase 
[Page 129, Line 44] me in knowledge.”  115. And We covenanted with Adam before, 
[Page 129, Line 45] but he forgot, and We found i n him no re-
[Page 129, Line 46] solve.  
[Page 129, Line 47] 116. And when We said to the angels, “Bow 
[Page 129, Line 48] down to Adam.” They bowed down, except 
[Page 129, Line 49] for Satan; he refused.  
[Page 129, Line 50] 117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you 
[Page 129, Line 51] and to your wife. So do not let him make you 
[Page 129, Line 52] leave the Garden, for then you will suffer . 
[Page 129, Line 53] 118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na-
[Page 129, Line 54] ked. 
[Page 129, Line 55] 119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you 
[Page 129, Line 56] swelter.”  
[Page 129, Line 57] 120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O 
[Page 129, Line 58] Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor-tality, and a kingdom that never decays?”  
[Page 129, Line 59] 121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their 
[Page 129, Line 60] bodies became visible to them, and they 
[Page 129, Line 61] started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, 
[Page 129, Line 62] and fell.  
[Page 129, Line 63] 122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par-
[Page 129, Line 64] doned him, and guided him.  
[Page 129, Line 65] 123. He said, “Go  down from it, altogether; 
[Page 129, Line 66] some of you enemies of some others. But 
[Page 129, Line 67] whenever guidance comes to you from Me, 
[Page 129, Line 68] whoever follows My guidance, will not go 
[Page 129, Line 69] astray, nor suffer.  
[Page 129, Line 70] 124. But whoever turns away from My Re-
[Page 129, Line 71] minder, for him is a confined life. And We 
[Page 129, Line 72] will ra ise him on the Day of Resurrection 
[Page 129, Line 73] blind.”  
[Page 129, Line 74] 125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise 
[Page 129, Line 75] me blind, though I was seeing?”  
[Page 129, Line 76] 126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came 
[Page 129, Line 77] to you, and you forgot them, today you will 
[Page 129, Line 78] be forgotten.”  
[Page 129, Line 79] 127. Thus We recompense him who trans-
[Page 129, Line 80] gresses and does not believe in the revelations 
[Page 129, Line 81] of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter 
[Page 129, Line 82] is more severe, and more lasting.  
[Page 129, Line 83] 128. Is it not instructive to them, how many 
[Page 129, Line 84] generations before them We destroyed, in 
[Page 129, Line 85] 118 
[Page 130, Line 1] 21.  THE PROPHETS   (al-Anbiya)  
[Page 130, Line 2] whose settlements they walk? Surel y in that 
[Page 130, Line 3] are signs for people of understanding.  
[Page 130, Line 4] 129. Were it not for a word that issued from 
[Page 130, Line 5] your Lord, the inevitable would have hap-
[Page 130, Line 6] pened, but there is an appointed term.  
[Page 130, Line 7] 130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele-
[Page 130, Line 8] brate the praises of your Lord before  the ris-
[Page 130, Line 9] ing of the sun, and before its setting. And 
[Page 130, Line 10] during the hours of the night glorify Him, 
[Page 130, Line 11] and at the borders of the day, that you may be 
[Page 130, Line 12] satisfied.  
[Page 130, Line 13] 131. And do not extend your glance towards 
[Page 130, Line 14] what We have given some classes of them to enjoy —the splendo r of the life of this world —
[Page 130, Line 15] that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s 
[Page 130, Line 16] provision is better, and more lasting.  
[Page 130, Line 17] 132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa-
[Page 130, Line 18] tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste-
[Page 130, Line 19] nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good 
[Page 130, Line 20] ending is tha t for righteousness.  
[Page 130, Line 21] 133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us 
[Page 130, Line 22] a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not 
[Page 130, Line 23] given enough miracles in the former scrip-
[Page 130, Line 24] tures?  
[Page 130, Line 25] 134. Had We destroyed them with a punish-
[Page 130, Line 26] ment before him, they would have said, “Our 
[Page 130, Line 27] Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we 
[Page 130, Line 28] would have followed Your revelations before 
[Page 130, Line 29] we were humiliated and disgraced.”  
[Page 130, Line 30] 135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You 
[Page 130, Line 31] will know who the people of the straight path are, and who is rightly -guided.  

[Page 130, Line 33] 21. THE PROPHETS  
[Page 130, Line 34] (al-Anbiya) 
[Page 130, Line 35] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 130, Line 36] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 130, Line 37] 1. Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but 
[Page 130, Line 38] they turn away heedlessly.  
[Page 130, Line 39] 2. No fresh reminder comes to them from 
[Page 130, Line 40] their Lord, but they listen to it playfully.  
[Page 130, Line 41] 3. Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers 
[Page 130, Line 42] confer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open -
[Page 130, Line 43] eyes?”  
[Page 130, Line 44] 4. He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the 
[Page 130, Line 45] heaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer, the Knower.”  
[Page 130, Line 46] 5. And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and, 
[Page 130, Line 47] “He ma de it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him 
[Page 130, Line 48] bring us a sign, like those sent to the an-cients.”  
[Page 130, Line 49] 6. None of the towns We destroyed before 
[Page 130, Line 50] them had believed. Will they, then, believe?  
[Page 130, Line 51] 7. We did not send before you except men, 
[Page 130, Line 52] whom We inspired. Ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.  
[Page 130, Line 53] 8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate 
[Page 130, Line 54] no food, nor were they immortal.  
[Page 130, Line 55] 9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, 
[Page 130, Line 56] and We saved them together with whomever 
[Page 130, Line 57] We willed, and We destroyed the extrava-
[Page 130, Line 58] gant.  
[Page 130, Line 59] 10. We have sent d own to you a Book, contain-
[Page 130, Line 60] ing your message. Do you not understand?  
[Page 130, Line 61] 11. How many a guilty town have We crushed, 
[Page 130, Line 62] and established thereafter another people?  
[Page 130, Line 63] 12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they 
[Page 130, Line 64] started running away from it.  
[Page 130, Line 65] 13. Do not run, but come back  to your luxu-
[Page 130, Line 66] ries, and to your homes, that you may be 
[Page 130, Line 67] questioned.  
[Page 130, Line 68] 14. They said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.”  
[Page 130, Line 69] 15. This continued to be their cry, until We 
[Page 130, Line 70] made them silent ashes.  
[Page 130, Line 71] 16. We did not create the sky and the earth and 
[Page 130, Line 72] what is between them for amus ement.  
[Page 130, Line 73] 17. If We wanted amusement, We could have 
[Page 130, Line 74] found it within Us, were We to do so.  
[Page 130, Line 75] 18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood, 
[Page 130, Line 76] and it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto 
[Page 130, Line 77] you, for what you describe.  
[Page 130, Line 78] 19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens 
[Page 130, Line 79] and the earth. Those near Him are not too 
[Page 130, Line 80] proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.  
[Page 130, Line 81] 119 
[Page 131, Line 1] 21.  THE PROPHETS   (al-Anbiya)  
[Page 131, Line 2] 20. They praise night and day, without ever tir-
[Page 131, Line 3] ing. 
[Page 131, Line 4] 21. Or have they taken to themselves gods 
[Page 131, Line 5] from the earth who resurrect?  
[Page 131, Line 6] 22. If there were in them gods other than Al-
[Page 131, Line 7] lah, they  would have gone to ruin. So glory be 
[Page 131, Line 8] to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what 
[Page 131, Line 9] they allege.  
[Page 131, Line 10] 23. He will not be questioned about what He 
[Page 131, Line 11] does, but they will be questioned.  
[Page 131, Line 12] 24. Or have they taken, besides Him, other 
[Page 131, Line 13] gods? Say, “Bring your proof. This is a m es-
[Page 131, Line 14] sage for those with me, and a message of those before me.” But most of them do not 
[Page 131, Line 15] know the truth, so they turn away.  
[Page 131, Line 16] 25. We never sent a messenger before you 
[Page 131, Line 17] without inspiring him that: “There is no god 
[Page 131, Line 18] but I, so worship Me.”  
[Page 131, Line 19] 26. And they say, “The Most  Merciful has 
[Page 131, Line 20] taken to himself a son.” Be He glorified; they 
[Page 131, Line 21] are but honored servants.  
[Page 131, Line 22] 27. They never speak before He has spoken, 
[Page 131, Line 23] and they only act on His command.  
[Page 131, Line 24] 28. He knows what is before them, and what is 
[Page 131, Line 25] behind them; and they do not intercede ex-
[Page 131, Line 26] cept for him whom He approves; and they 
[Page 131, Line 27] tremble in awe of Him.  
[Page 131, Line 28] 29. And whoever of them says, “I am a god be-
[Page 131, Line 29] sides Him,” We will reward him with Hell. 
[Page 131, Line 30] Thus We reward the wrongdoers.  
[Page 131, Line 31] 30. Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens 
[Page 131, Line 32] and the earth were one mass, and  We tore 
[Page 131, Line 33] them apart? And We made from water every 
[Page 131, Line 34] living thing. Will they not believe?  
[Page 131, Line 35] 31. And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it 
[Page 131, Line 36] sways with them, and We placed therein 
[Page 131, Line 37] signposts and passages, that they may be 
[Page 131, Line 38] guided.  
[Page 131, Line 39] 32. And We made the sky a protected ceiling; 
[Page 131, Line 40] yet they turn away from its wonders.  
[Page 131, Line 41] 33. It is He who created the night and the day, 
[Page 131, Line 42] and the sun and the moon; each floating in an 
[Page 131, Line 43] orbit.  34. We did not grant immortality to any hu-
[Page 131, Line 44] man being before you. Should you die, are 
[Page 131, Line 45] they then the immorta l? 
[Page 131, Line 46] 35. Every soul will taste death. We burden you 
[Page 131, Line 47] with adversity and prosperity —a test. And to 
[Page 131, Line 48] Us you will be returned.  
[Page 131, Line 49] 36. When those who disbelieve see you, they 
[Page 131, Line 50] treat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one who mentions your gods?” And they reject 
[Page 131, Line 51] the mention of the Merciful.  
[Page 131, Line 52] 37. The human being was created of haste. I 
[Page 131, Line 53] will show you My signs, so do not seek to rush Me. 
[Page 131, Line 54] 38. And they say, “When will this promise 
[Page 131, Line 55] come true, if you are truthful?”  
[Page 131, Line 56] 39. If those who disbelieve only knew, when 
[Page 131, Line 57] they cannot keep the fire off their faces and 
[Page 131, Line 58] off their backs, and they will not be helped.  
[Page 131, Line 59] 40. In fact, it will come upon them suddenly, 
[Page 131, Line 60] and bewilder them. They will not be able to 
[Page 131, Line 61] repel it, and they will not be reprieved.  
[Page 131, Line 62] 41. Messengers before you were also ridiculed, 
[Page 131, Line 63] but those who jeered were surrounded by 
[Page 131, Line 64] what they had ridiculed.  
[Page 131, Line 65] 42. Say, “Who guards you against the Merciful 
[Page 131, Line 66] by night and by day?” But they turn away 
[Page 131, Line 67] from the mention of their Lord.  
[Page 131, Line 68] 43. Or do they have gods who can defend them 
[Page 131, Line 69] against Us? They cannot help themselves, nor 
[Page 131, Line 70] will they be protected from Us.  
[Page 131, Line 71] 44. We have given these enjoyments, and their 
[Page 131, Line 72] ancestors, until time grew long upon them. Do they not see how We gradually reduce the 
[Page 131, Line 73] land from its extremities? Are they then the 
[Page 131, Line 74] victors?  
[Page 131, Line 75] 45. Say, “I am warning you through inspira-
[Page 131, Line 76] tion.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when 
[Page 131, Line 77] they are being warned.  
[Page 131, Line 78] 46. And when a breath of your Lord’s punish-
[Page 131, Line 79] ment touches them, they say, “Woe to us, we were truly wicked.”  
[Page 131, Line 80] 47. We will set up the scales of justice for the 
[Page 131, Line 81] Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will suf-
[Page 131, Line 82] fer the least injustice. And even if it be the 
[Page 131, Line 83] 120 
[Page 132, Line 1] 21.  THE PROPHETS   (al-Anbiya)  
[Page 132, Line 2] weight of a mustard -seed, We will bring it up. 
[Page 132, Line 3] Sufficient are We as Reckoners.  
[Page 132, Line 4] 48. We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, 
[Page 132, Line 5] and illumination, and a reminder for the 
[Page 132, Line 6] right eous.  
[Page 132, Line 7] 49. Those who fear their Lord in private, and 
[Page 132, Line 8] are apprehensive of the Hour.  
[Page 132, Line 9] 50. This too is a blessed message that We re-
[Page 132, Line 10] vealed. Are you going to deny it?  
[Page 132, Line 11] 51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly, 
[Page 132, Line 12] and We knew him well.  
[Page 132, Line 13] 52. When he said to his father  and his people, 
[Page 132, Line 14] “What are these statues to which you are de-
[Page 132, Line 15] voted?”  
[Page 132, Line 16] 53. They said, “We found our parents wor-
[Page 132, Line 17] shiping them.” 
[Page 132, Line 18] 54. He said, “You and your parents are in evi-
[Page 132, Line 19] dent error.”  
[Page 132, Line 20] 55. They said, “Are you telling us the truth, or 
[Page 132, Line 21] are you just playing?”  
[Page 132, Line 22] 56. He said, “Your Lord is the Lord of the 
[Page 132, Line 23] heavens and the earth, the One who created 
[Page 132, Line 24] them, and I bear witness to that.  
[Page 132, Line 25] 57. “By Allah, I will have a plan for your statues 
[Page 132, Line 26] after you have gone away.”  
[Page 132, Line 27] 58. So he reduced them into pieces, except for 
[Page 132, Line 28] their biggest,  that they may return to it.  
[Page 132, Line 29] 59. They said, “Who did this to our gods? He 
[Page 132, Line 30] is certainly one of the wrongdoers.”  
[Page 132, Line 31] 60. They said, “We heard a youth mentioning 
[Page 132, Line 32] them. He is called Abraham.”  
[Page 132, Line 33] 61. They said, “Bring him before the eyes of the 
[Page 132, Line 34] people, so that they ma y witness.”  
[Page 132, Line 35] 62. They said, “Are you the one who did this to 
[Page 132, Line 36] our gods, O Abraham?”  
[Page 132, Line 37] 63. He said, “But it was this biggest of them 
[Page 132, Line 38] that did it. Ask them, if they can speak.”  
[Page 132, Line 39] 64. Then they turned to one another, and said, 
[Page 132, Line 40] “You yourselves are the wrongdoers.”  
[Page 132, Line 41] 65. But they reverted to their old ideas: “You 
[Page 132, Line 42] certainly know that these do not speak.”  66. He said, “Do you worship, instead of Allah, 
[Page 132, Line 43] what can neither benefit you in anything, nor 
[Page 132, Line 44] harm you?  
[Page 132, Line 45] 67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in-
[Page 132, Line 46] stead of Allah. Do you  not understand?”  
[Page 132, Line 47] 68. They said, “Burn him and support your 
[Page 132, Line 48] gods, if you are going to act.”  
[Page 132, Line 49] 69. We said, “O fire, be coolness and safety 
[Page 132, Line 50] upon Abraham.”  
[Page 132, Line 51] 70. They planned to harm him, but We made 
[Page 132, Line 52] them the worst losers.  
[Page 132, Line 53] 71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to t he land 
[Page 132, Line 54] that We blessed for all people.  
[Page 132, Line 55] 72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a 
[Page 132, Line 56] gift; and each We made righteous.  
[Page 132, Line 57] 73. And We made them leaders, guiding by 
[Page 132, Line 58] Our command; and We inspired them to do 
[Page 132, Line 59] good works, and to observe the prayer, and to 
[Page 132, Line 60] give out charity. They were devoted servants 
[Page 132, Line 61] to Us.  
[Page 132, Line 62] 74. And Lot— We gave him judgment and 
[Page 132, Line 63] knowledge, and We delivered him from the 
[Page 132, Line 64] town that practiced the abominations. They 
[Page 132, Line 65] were wicked and perverted people.  
[Page 132, Line 66] 75. And We admitted him into Our mercy; for 
[Page 132, Line 67] He was one of th e righteous.  
[Page 132, Line 68] 76. And Noah, when he called before. So We 
[Page 132, Line 69] answered him, and delivered him and his 
[Page 132, Line 70] family from the great disaster.  
[Page 132, Line 71] 77. And We supported him against the people 
[Page 132, Line 72] who rejected Our signs. They were an evil 
[Page 132, Line 73] people, so We drowned them all.  
[Page 132, Line 74] 78. And David and Solomon, when they gave 
[Page 132, Line 75] judgment in the case of the field, when some people’s sheep wandered therein by night; 
[Page 132, Line 76] and We were witnesses to their judgment.  
[Page 132, Line 77] 79. And so We made Solomon understand it, 
[Page 132, Line 78] and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge. 
[Page 132, Line 79] And We subje cted the mountains along with 
[Page 132, Line 80] David to sing Our praises, and the birds as 
[Page 132, Line 81] well—surely We did.  
[Page 132, Line 82] 80. And We taught him the making of shields 
[Page 132, Line 83] for you, to protect you from your violence. 
[Page 132, Line 84] Are you, then, appreciative?  
[Page 132, Line 85] 121 
[Page 133, Line 1] 21.  THE PROPHETS   (al-Anbiya)  
[Page 133, Line 2] 81. And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing 
[Page 133, Line 3] at His command towards the land that We 
[Page 133, Line 4] have blessed. We are aware of everything.  
[Page 133, Line 5] 82. And of the devils were some that dived for 
[Page 133, Line 6] him, and performed other, lesser tasks. But 
[Page 133, Line 7] We kept them restrained.  
[Page 133, Line 8] 83. And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: 
[Page 133, Line 9] “Great harm has  afflicted me, and you are the 
[Page 133, Line 10] Most Merciful of the merciful.” 
[Page 133, Line 11] 84. So We answered him, lifted his suffering, 
[Page 133, Line 12] and restored his family to him, and their like 
[Page 133, Line 13] with them —a mercy from Us, and a reminder 
[Page 133, Line 14] for the worshipers.  
[Page 133, Line 15] 85. And Ishmael, and Enoch, and Ezekie l; each 
[Page 133, Line 16] was one of the steadfast.  
[Page 133, Line 17] 86. And We admitted them into Our mercy. 
[Page 133, Line 18] They were among the righteous.  
[Page 133, Line 19] 87. And Jonah, when he stormed out in fury, 
[Page 133, Line 20] thinking We had no power over him. But 
[Page 133, Line 21] then He cried out in the darkness, “There is 
[Page 133, Line 22] no god but You! Glory to You! I was one of 
[Page 133, Line 23] the wrongdoers!”  
[Page 133, Line 24] 88. So We answered him, and saved him from 
[Page 133, Line 25] the affliction. Thus We save the faithful.  
[Page 133, Line 26] 89. And Zechariah, when he called out to his 
[Page 133, Line 27] Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, even though you are the Best of heirs.”  
[Page 133, Line 28] 90. So W e answered him, and gave him John. 
[Page 133, Line 29] And We cured his wife for him. They used to 
[Page 133, Line 30] vie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call 
[Page 133, Line 31] on Us in love and awe, and they used to hum-
[Page 133, Line 32] ble themselves to Us.  
[Page 133, Line 33] 91. And she who guarded her virginity. We 
[Page 133, Line 34] breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her 
[Page 133, Line 35] and her son a sign to the world.  
[Page 133, Line 36] 92. This community of yours is one commu-
[Page 133, Line 37] nity, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.  
[Page 133, Line 38] 93. But they splintered themselves into fac-
[Page 133, Line 39] tions. They will all return to Us.  
[Page 133, Line 40] 94. Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a be-
[Page 133, Line 41] liever, his effort will not be denied. We are 
[Page 133, Line 42] writing it down for him.   
[Page 133, Line 43] 95. There is a ban on the town that We had de-
[Page 133, Line 44] stroyed —that they will not return.  96. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, 
[Page 133, Line 45] and they swarm down from every mound.  
[Page 133, Line 46] 97. The promi se of truth has drawn near. The 
[Page 133, Line 47] eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in 
[Page 133, Line 48] horror: “Woe to us. We were oblivious to 
[Page 133, Line 49] this. In fact, we were wrongdoers.”  
[Page 133, Line 50] 98. You and what you worship besides Allah 
[Page 133, Line 51] are fuel for Hell. You will descend into it.  
[Page 133, Line 52] 99. Had these b een gods, they would not have 
[Page 133, Line 53] descended into it. All will abide in it.  
[Page 133, Line 54] 100. In it they will wail. In it they will not hear.  
[Page 133, Line 55] 101. As for those who deserved goodness from 
[Page 133, Line 56] Us—these will be kept away from it.  
[Page 133, Line 57] 102. They will not hear its hissing, and they will 
[Page 133, Line 58] forever abide in what their hearts desire.  
[Page 133, Line 59] 103. The Supreme Fear will not worry them, 
[Page 133, Line 60] and the angels will receive them: “This is your Day which you were promised.” 
[Page 133, Line 61] 104. On the Day when We fold the heaven, like 
[Page 133, Line 62] the folding of a book. Just as We began the 
[Page 133, Line 63] first creation, We will repeat it —a promise 
[Page 133, Line 64] binding on Us. We will act.  
[Page 133, Line 65] 105. We have written in the Psalms, after the 
[Page 133, Line 66] Reminder, that the earth will be inherited by 
[Page 133, Line 67] My righteous servants.  
[Page 133, Line 68] 106. Indeed, in this is a message for people who 
[Page 133, Line 69] worship.  
[Page 133, Line 70] 107. We did n ot send you except as mercy to 
[Page 133, Line 71] mankind.  
[Page 133, Line 72] 108. Say, “It is revealed to me that your God is 
[Page 133, Line 73] One God. Are you going to submit?”  
[Page 133, Line 74] 109. But if they turn away, say, “I have in-
[Page 133, Line 75] formed you sufficiently. Although I do not 
[Page 133, Line 76] know whether what you are promised is near 
[Page 133, Line 77] or far.”  
[Page 133, Line 78] 110. He knows what is said openly, and He 
[Page 133, Line 79] knows what you conceal.  
[Page 133, Line 80] 111. “And I do not know whether it is perhaps 
[Page 133, Line 81] a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”  
[Page 133, Line 82] 112. He said, “My Lord, judge with justice.” 
[Page 133, Line 83] And, “Our Lord is the Gracious, Whose help 
[Page 133, Line 84] is sought against what you allege.”  

[Page 133, Line 86] 122 
[Page 134, Line 1] 22.  THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj)  
[Page 134, Line 2] 22. THE PILGRIMAGE  
[Page 134, Line 3] (al-Hajj) 
[Page 134, Line 4] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 134, Line 5] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 134, Line 6] 1. O people, be conscious of your Lord. The 
[Page 134, Line 7] quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.  
[Page 134, Line 8] 2. On the Day when you will see it: every nurs-
[Page 134, Line 9] ing mother will discard her infant, and every 
[Page 134, Line 10] pregnant woman will abort her load, and you 
[Page 134, Line 11] will see the people drunk, even though they 
[Page 134, Line 12] are not drunk —but the punishment of Allah 
[Page 134, Line 13] is severe.  
[Page 134, Line 14] 3. Among the people is he who argues about 
[Page 134, Line 15] Allah without knowledge, and f ollows every 
[Page 134, Line 16] defiant devil.  
[Page 134, Line 17] 4. It was decreed for him, that whoever follows 
[Page 134, Line 18] him—he will misguide him, and lead him to 
[Page 134, Line 19] the torment of the Blaze.  
[Page 134, Line 20] 5. O people! If you are in doubt about the Res-
[Page 134, Line 21] urrection —We created you from dust, then 
[Page 134, Line 22] from a small drop, then f rom a clinging clot, 
[Page 134, Line 23] then from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify 
[Page 134, Line 24] things for you. And We settle in the wombs 
[Page 134, Line 25] whatever We will for a designated term, and 
[Page 134, Line 26] then We bring you out as infants, until you 
[Page 134, Line 27] reach your full strength. And some of you will 
[Page 134, Line 28] pass away, and some of you will be returned 
[Page 134, Line 29] to the vilest age, so that he may not know, af-
[Page 134, Line 30] ter having known. And you see the earth still; 
[Page 134, Line 31] but when We send down water on it, it vi-
[Page 134, Line 32] brates, and swells, and grows all kinds of 
[Page 134, Line 33] lovel y pairs.  
[Page 134, Line 34] 6. That is because Allah is the truth, and be-
[Page 134, Line 35] cause He gives life to the dead, and because 
[Page 134, Line 36] He is Capable of everything.  
[Page 134, Line 37] 7. And because the Hour is coming —there is 
[Page 134, Line 38] no doubt about it— and because Allah will 
[Page 134, Line 39] resurrect those in the graves.  
[Page 134, Line 40] 8. And among the people is he who argues 
[Page 134, Line 41] about Allah without knowledge, or guidance, 
[Page 134, Line 42] or an enlightening scripture.  9. Turning aside in contempt, to lead away 
[Page 134, Line 43] from the path of Allah. He will have humilia-
[Page 134, Line 44] tion in this world, and on the Day of Resur-
[Page 134, Line 45] rection We will make him  taste the agony of 
[Page 134, Line 46] burning.  
[Page 134, Line 47] 10. That is for what your hands have advanced, 
[Page 134, Line 48] and because Allah is not unjust to the serv-
[Page 134, Line 49] ants.  
[Page 134, Line 50] 11. And among the people is he who worships 
[Page 134, Line 51] Allah on edge. When something good comes 
[Page 134, Line 52] his way, he is content with it. But when an or-
[Page 134, Line 53] deal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He 
[Page 134, Line 54] loses this world and the next. That is the ob-
[Page 134, Line 55] vious loss.  
[Page 134, Line 56] 12. He invokes, instead of Allah, what can nei-
[Page 134, Line 57] ther harm him nor benefit him. That is the far 
[Page 134, Line 58] straying.  
[Page 134, Line 59] 13. He invokes one whose harm is closer than 
[Page 134, Line 60] his b enefit. What a miserable master. What a 
[Page 134, Line 61] miserable companion.  
[Page 134, Line 62] 14. Allah will admit those who believe and do 
[Page 134, Line 63] righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which 
[Page 134, Line 64] rivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.  
[Page 134, Line 65] 15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help 
[Page 134, Line 66] him in this life an d in the Hereafter —let him 
[Page 134, Line 67] turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun-
[Page 134, Line 68] ning eliminates what enrages him.  
[Page 134, Line 69] 16. Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and 
[Page 134, Line 70] Allah guides whomever He wills.  
[Page 134, Line 71] 17. Those who believe, and those who are Jew-
[Page 134, Line 72] ish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and 
[Page 134, Line 73] the Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists —Allah 
[Page 134, Line 74] will judge between them on the Day of Res-
[Page 134, Line 75] urrection. Allah is witness to all things.  
[Page 134, Line 76] 18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates 
[Page 134, Line 77] everyone in the heavens and everyone on 
[Page 134, Line 78] earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and 
[Page 134, Line 79] the animals, and many of the people? But 
[Page 134, Line 80] many are justly deserving of punishment. 
[Page 134, Line 81] Whomever Allah shames, there is none to 
[Page 134, Line 82] honor him. Allah does whatever He wills.  
[Page 134, Line 83] 19. Here are two adversa ries feuding regarding 
[Page 134, Line 84] their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, gar-
[Page 134, Line 85] ments of fire will be tailored for them, and 
[Page 134, Line 86] 123 
[Page 135, Line 1] 22.  THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj)  
[Page 135, Line 2] scalding water will be poured over their 
[Page 135, Line 3] heads.  
[Page 135, Line 4] 20. Melting their insides and their skins.  
[Page 135, Line 5] 21. And they will have maces of iron.  
[Page 135, Line 6] 22. Whenever th ey try to escape the gloom, 
[Page 135, Line 7] they will be driven back to it: “Taste the suf-fering of burning.”  
[Page 135, Line 8] 23. But Allah will admit those who believe and 
[Page 135, Line 9] do good deeds into Gardens beneath which 
[Page 135, Line 10] rivers flow. They will be decorated therein 
[Page 135, Line 11] with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their 
[Page 135, Line 12] garments therein will be of silk.  
[Page 135, Line 13] 24. They were guided to purity of speech. They 
[Page 135, Line 14] were guided to the path of the Most Praised.  
[Page 135, Line 15] 25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from 
[Page 135, Line 16] Allah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque —
[Page 135, Line 17] which We have designated for  all mankind 
[Page 135, Line 18] equally, whether residing therein or passing 
[Page 135, Line 19] through— and seek to commit sacrilege 
[Page 135, Line 20] therein —We will make him taste of a painful 
[Page 135, Line 21] punishment.  
[Page 135, Line 22] 26. We showed Abraham the location of the 
[Page 135, Line 23] House: “Do not associate anything with Me; 
[Page 135, Line 24] and purify My House for those who circle 
[Page 135, Line 25] around, and those who stand to pray, and 
[Page 135, Line 26] those who kneel and prostrate.”  
[Page 135, Line 27] 27. And announce the pilgrimage to human-
[Page 135, Line 28] ity. They will come to you on foot, and on 
[Page 135, Line 29] every transport. They will come from every 
[Page 135, Line 30] distant point.  
[Page 135, Line 31] 28. That they may wit ness the benefits for 
[Page 135, Line 32] themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah 
[Page 135, Line 33] during the appointed days, for providing 
[Page 135, Line 34] them with the animal livestock. So eat from 
[Page 135, Line 35] it, and feed the unfortunate poor.  
[Page 135, Line 36] 29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans-
[Page 135, Line 37] ing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around 
[Page 135, Line 38] the Ancient House.  
[Page 135, Line 39] 30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities 
[Page 135, Line 40] of Allah— it is good for him with his Lord. All 
[Page 135, Line 41] livestock are permitted to you, except what is 
[Page 135, Line 42] recited to you. So stay away from the abomi-
[Page 135, Line 43] nation of idols, and stay away from perjury.  31. Being true to Allah, without associating an-
[Page 135, Line 44] ything with Him. Whoever associates any-
[Page 135, Line 45] thing with Allah— it is as though he has fallen 
[Page 135, Line 46] from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or 
[Page 135, Line 47] is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.  
[Page 135, Line 48] 32. So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments 
[Page 135, Line 49] of Allah— it is from the piety of the hearts.  
[Page 135, Line 50] 33. In them are benefits for you until a certain 
[Page 135, Line 51] time. Then their place is by the Ancient 
[Page 135, Line 52] House.  
[Page 135, Line 53] 34. We have appointed a rite for every nation, 
[Page 135, Line 54] that they may commemorate Allah’s name 
[Page 135, Line 55] over the livestock He has provided for them. Your God is One God, so to Him submit, and 
[Page 135, Line 56] announce good news to the humble.  
[Page 135, Line 57] 35. Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is 
[Page 135, Line 58] mentioned, and those who endure what has befallen them, and those who perform the 
[Page 135, Line 59] prayer and spend from what We have pro-
[Page 135, Line 60] vided for them.  
[Page 135, Line 61] 36. We have made the animal offerings em-
[Page 135, Line 62] blems of Allah for you. In them is goodness 
[Page 135, Line 63] for you. So pronounce Allah’s name upon 
[Page 135, Line 64] them as they line up. Then, when they have 
[Page 135, Line 65] fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the 
[Page 135, Line 66] contented and the beggar. Thus We have sub-
[Page 135, Line 67] jected them to you, that you may be thankful.  
[Page 135, Line 68] 37. Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever 
[Page 135, Line 69] reaches Allah. What reaches Him is the right-
[Page 135, Line 70] eousness from you. Thus He subdued them 
[Page 135, Line 71] to you, that you may glori fy Allah for guiding 
[Page 135, Line 72] you. And give good news to the charitable.  
[Page 135, Line 73] 38. Allah defends those who believe. Allah 
[Page 135, Line 74] does not love any ungrateful traitor.  
[Page 135, Line 75] 39. Permission is given to those who are 
[Page 135, Line 76] fought against, and Allah is Able to give them 
[Page 135, Line 77] victory.  
[Page 135, Line 78] 40. Those who were unjustly evicted from 
[Page 135, Line 79] their homes, merely for saying, “Our Lord is 
[Page 135, Line 80] Allah.” Were it not that Allah repels people by means of others: monasteries, churches, 
[Page 135, Line 81] synagogues, and mosques —where the name 
[Page 135, Line 82] of Allah is mentioned much —would have 
[Page 135, Line 83] been demolished. Al lah supports whoever 
[Page 135, Line 84] supports Him. Allah is Strong and Mighty.  
[Page 135, Line 85] 124 
[Page 136, Line 1] 22.  THE PILGRIMAGE   (al-Hajj)  
[Page 136, Line 2] 41. Those who, when We empower them in the 
[Page 136, Line 3] land, observe the prayer, and give regular 
[Page 136, Line 4] charity, and command what is right, and for-
[Page 136, Line 5] bid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the out-
[Page 136, Line 6] come of events.  
[Page 136, Line 7] 42. If they deny you— before them the people 
[Page 136, Line 8] of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.  
[Page 136, Line 9] 43. And the people of Abraham, and the peo-
[Page 136, Line 10] ple of Lot.  
[Page 136, Line 11] 44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses 
[Page 136, Line 12] was denied. Then I reprieved those who dis-
[Page 136, Line 13] believed, but then I seized them.  So how was 
[Page 136, Line 14] My rejection?  
[Page 136, Line 15] 45. How many a town have We destroyed 
[Page 136, Line 16] while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins; 
[Page 136, Line 17] with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.  
[Page 136, Line 18] 46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and 
[Page 136, Line 19] had minds to reason with, or ears to listen with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is 
[Page 136, Line 20] the hearts, within the chests, that go blind.  
[Page 136, Line 21] 47. And they ask you to hasten the punish-
[Page 136, Line 22] ment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A 
[Page 136, Line 23] day with your Lord is like a thousand years of 
[Page 136, Line 24] your count.  
[Page 136, Line 25] 48. How many a town have I repriev ed, alt-
[Page 136, Line 26] hough it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me 
[Page 136, Line 27] is the destination.  
[Page 136, Line 28] 49. Say, “O people, I am only a plain warner to 
[Page 136, Line 29] you.”  
[Page 136, Line 30] 50. Those who believe and work righteous-
[Page 136, Line 31] ness—for them is forgiveness and a generous 
[Page 136, Line 32] provision.  
[Page 136, Line 33] 51. But those who strive against Ou r revela-
[Page 136, Line 34] tions —these are the inmates of Hell.  
[Page 136, Line 35] 52. We never sent a messenger before you, or 
[Page 136, Line 36] a prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in-
[Page 136, Line 37] terfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what 
[Page 136, Line 38] Satan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela-
[Page 136, Line 39] tions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.  
[Page 136, Line 40] 53. In order to make Satan’s suggestions a trial 
[Page 136, Line 41] for those whose hearts are diseased, and those 
[Page 136, Line 42] whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers 
[Page 136, Line 43] are in profound discord.  54. And so that those endowed with 
[Page 136, Line 44] knowledge may know that it is the truth from 
[Page 136, Line 45] your Lord, and so believe in it, and their 
[Page 136, Line 46] hearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be-
[Page 136, Line 47] lieve to a straight path.  
[Page 136, Line 48] 55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be 
[Page 136, Line 49] hesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon 
[Page 136, Line 50] them suddenly, or there comes to them the 
[Page 136, Line 51] torment of a  desolate Day.  
[Page 136, Line 52] 56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah; 
[Page 136, Line 53] He will judge between them. Those who be-
[Page 136, Line 54] lieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar-
[Page 136, Line 55] dens of Bliss.  
[Page 136, Line 56] 57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our 
[Page 136, Line 57] revelations —these will have a humiliating 
[Page 136, Line 58] punishment.  
[Page 136, Line 59] 58. Those who emigrate in Allah’s cause, then 
[Page 136, Line 60] get killed, or die, Allah will provide them with 
[Page 136, Line 61] fine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.  
[Page 136, Line 62] 59. He will admit them an admittance that will 
[Page 136, Line 63] please them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.  
[Page 136, Line 64] 60. That is so! Whoeve r retaliates similarly to 
[Page 136, Line 65] the affliction he was made to suffer, and then 
[Page 136, Line 66] he is wronged again, Allah will definitely as-
[Page 136, Line 67] sist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.  
[Page 136, Line 68] 61. That is because Allah merges the night into 
[Page 136, Line 69] the day, and He merges the day into the night,  
[Page 136, Line 70] and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
[Page 136, Line 71] 62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and 
[Page 136, Line 72] what they invoke besides Him is vanity, and 
[Page 136, Line 73] because Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.  
[Page 136, Line 74] 63. Do you not see that Allah sends down wa-
[Page 136, Line 75] ter from the sky, and the land becomes g reen? 
[Page 136, Line 76] Allah is Kind and Aware.  
[Page 136, Line 77] 64. To Him belongs everything in the heavens 
[Page 136, Line 78] and everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the 
[Page 136, Line 79] Praised.  
[Page 136, Line 80] 65. Do you not see that Allah made everything 
[Page 136, Line 81] on earth subservient to you? How the ships sail at sea by His command? That H e holds 
[Page 136, Line 82] up the sky lest it falls on earth —except by His 
[Page 136, Line 83] permission? Allah is Gracious towards the 
[Page 136, Line 84] people, Most Merciful.  
[Page 136, Line 85] 125 
[Page 137, Line 1] 23.  THE BELIEVERS   (al-Mu’minun)  
[Page 137, Line 2] 66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes 
[Page 137, Line 3] you die, then revives you. The human being 
[Page 137, Line 4] is unappreciative.  
[Page 137, Line 5] 67. For every congregati on We have appointed 
[Page 137, Line 6] acts of devotion, which they observe. So do 
[Page 137, Line 7] not let them dispute with you in this matter. 
[Page 137, Line 8] And invite to your Lord; you are upon a 
[Page 137, Line 9] straight guidance.  
[Page 137, Line 10] 68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is 
[Page 137, Line 11] fully aware of what you do.”  
[Page 137, Line 12] 69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of 
[Page 137, Line 13] Resurrection regarding what you disagree 
[Page 137, Line 14] about.  
[Page 137, Line 15] 70. Do you not know that Allah knows every-
[Page 137, Line 16] thing in the heavens and the earth? This is in 
[Page 137, Line 17] a book. That is easy for Allah.  
[Page 137, Line 18] 71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for 
[Page 137, Line 19] which He sent down no warrant, and what 
[Page 137, Line 20] they have no knowledge of. There is no savior 
[Page 137, Line 21] for the transgressors.  
[Page 137, Line 22] 72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to 
[Page 137, Line 23] them, you will recognize disgust on the faces 
[Page 137, Line 24] of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault 
[Page 137, Line 25] those who r ecite to them Our Verses. Say, 
[Page 137, Line 26] “Shall I inform you of something worse than 
[Page 137, Line 27] that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those 
[Page 137, Line 28] who disbelieve. And what a wretched out-
[Page 137, Line 29] come!”  
[Page 137, Line 30] 73. O people! A parable is presented, so listen 
[Page 137, Line 31] to it: Those you invoke besides Allah wi ll 
[Page 137, Line 32] never create a fly, even if they banded to-
[Page 137, Line 33] gether for that purpose. And if the fly steals 
[Page 137, Line 34] anything from them, they cannot recover it 
[Page 137, Line 35] from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pur-
[Page 137, Line 36] sued.  
[Page 137, Line 37] 74. They do not value Allah as He should be 
[Page 137, Line 38] valued. Allah is Strong and Po werful.  
[Page 137, Line 39] 75. Allah chooses messengers from among the 
[Page 137, Line 40] angels, and from among the people. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
[Page 137, Line 41] 76. He knows what is before them, and what is 
[Page 137, Line 42] behind them. To Allah all matters are re-
[Page 137, Line 43] ferred.  77. O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate, 
[Page 137, Line 44] and worship your Lord, and do good deeds, 
[Page 137, Line 45] so that you may succeed.  
[Page 137, Line 46] 78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due 
[Page 137, Line 47] to Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur-dened you in religion —the faith of your fa-
[Page 137, Line 48] ther Abraham. It is he who named you Mus-
[Page 137, Line 49] lims before, and in this. So that the Messen-
[Page 137, Line 50] ger may be a witness over you, and you may 
[Page 137, Line 51] be witnesses over the people. So pray regu-
[Page 137, Line 52] larly, and give regular charity, and cleave to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excel-
[Page 137, Line 53] lent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.  

[Page 137, Line 55] 23. THE BELIEVERS  
[Page 137, Line 56] (al-Mu’minun ) 
[Page 137, Line 57] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 137, Line 58] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 137, Line 59] 1. Successful are the believers.  
[Page 137, Line 60] 2. Those who are humble in their prayers.  
[Page 137, Line 61] 3. Those who avoid nonsense.  
[Page 137, Line 62] 4. Those who work for charity.  
[Page 137, Line 63] 5. Those who safeguard their chastity.  
[Page 137, Line 64] 6. Except  from their spouses, or their depend-
[Page 137, Line 65] ents—for then they are free from blame.  
[Page 137, Line 66] 7. But whoever seeks anything beyond that —
[Page 137, Line 67] these are the transgressors.  
[Page 137, Line 68] 8. Those who are faithful to their trusts and 
[Page 137, Line 69] pledges.  
[Page 137, Line 70] 9. Those who safeguard their prayers.  
[Page 137, Line 71] 10. These are the inheritors.  
[Page 137, Line 72] 11. Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they 
[Page 137, Line 73] will dwell forever.  
[Page 137, Line 74] 12. We created man from an extract of clay.  
[Page 137, Line 75] 13. Then We made him a seed, in a secure re-
[Page 137, Line 76] pository.  
[Page 137, Line 77] 14. Then We developed the seed into a clot. 
[Page 137, Line 78] Then We developed the clot into a l ump. 
[Page 137, Line 79] Then We developed the lump into bones. 
[Page 137, Line 80] Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then 
[Page 137, Line 81] We produced it into another creature. Most 
[Page 137, Line 82] Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.  
[Page 137, Line 83] 126 
[Page 138, Line 1] 23.  THE BELIEVERS   (al-Mu’minun)  
[Page 138, Line 2] 15. Then, after that, you will die.  
[Page 138, Line 3] 16. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will 
[Page 138, Line 4] be resurrected.  
[Page 138, Line 5] 17. We created above you seven pathways, and 
[Page 138, Line 6] We are never heedless of the creation.  
[Page 138, Line 7] 18. And We sent down water from the sky in 
[Page 138, Line 8] proper quantity, and settled it in the ground, 
[Page 138, Line 9] and We are Able to take it away.  
[Page 138, Line 10] 19. With it We produce for you garde ns of 
[Page 138, Line 11] palms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for you to eat.  
[Page 138, Line 12] 20. And a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, 
[Page 138, Line 13] producing oil, and seasoning for those who 
[Page 138, Line 14] eat. 
[Page 138, Line 15] 21. And there is a lesson for you in livestock: 
[Page 138, Line 16] We give you to drink from what is in their bellies, and you have many benefits in them, 
[Page 138, Line 17] and from them you eat.  
[Page 138, Line 18] 22. And on them, and on the ships, you are 
[Page 138, Line 19] transported.  
[Page 138, Line 20] 23. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O 
[Page 138, Line 21] my people, worship Allah, you have no deity other than Him. Will you not take heed?”  
[Page 138, Line 22] 24. But the notables of his people, who disbe-
[Page 138, Line 23] lieved, said, “This is nothing but a human like you, who wants to gain superiority over you. 
[Page 138, Line 24] Had Allah willed, He would have sent down 
[Page 138, Line 25] angels. We never heard of this from our fore-
[Page 138, Line 26] fathers of old.  
[Page 138, Line 27] 25. He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ig-
[Page 138, Line 28] nore him for a while.”  
[Page 138, Line 29] 26. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have 
[Page 138, Line 30] rejected me.”  
[Page 138, Line 31] 27. So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under 
[Page 138, Line 32] Our observation and by Our inspiration. And 
[Page 138, Line 33] when Our decree comes to pass, and the oven 
[Page 138, Line 34] boils over, load into  it two pairs of every kind, 
[Page 138, Line 35] together with your family, except those of 
[Page 138, Line 36] them against whom the word has already 
[Page 138, Line 37] been pronounced. And do not speak to me 
[Page 138, Line 38] concerning those who did wrong; for they are to be drowned.”  28. Then, when you and those with you are se t-
[Page 138, Line 39] tled in the Ark, say, “Praise be to Allah, who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.”  
[Page 138, Line 40] 29. And say, “My Lord, land me with a blessed 
[Page 138, Line 41] landing, as you are the best of transporters.”  
[Page 138, Line 42] 30. Surely in that are signs. We are always test-
[Page 138, Line 43] ing. 
[Page 138, Line 44] 31. Then, after them, We established another 
[Page 138, Line 45] generation.  
[Page 138, Line 46] 32. And We sent among them a messenger 
[Page 138, Line 47] from themselves: “Serve Allah. You have no 
[Page 138, Line 48] god other than Him. Will you not be cau-
[Page 138, Line 49] tious?”  
[Page 138, Line 50] 33. But the dignitaries of his people, those who 
[Page 138, Line 51] disbelieved and denied the meeting of  the 
[Page 138, Line 52] Hereafter, and We had indulged them in the 
[Page 138, Line 53] present life, said, “This is nothing but a hu-
[Page 138, Line 54] man like you; he eats what you eat, and he 
[Page 138, Line 55] drinks what you drink.  
[Page 138, Line 56] 34. If you obey a human being like yourselves, 
[Page 138, Line 57] then you will be losers.  
[Page 138, Line 58] 35. Does he promise you t hat when you have 
[Page 138, Line 59] died and become dust and bones, you will be 
[Page 138, Line 60] brought out?  
[Page 138, Line 61] 36. Farfetched, farfetched is what you are 
[Page 138, Line 62] promised.  
[Page 138, Line 63] 37. There is nothing but our life in this world. 
[Page 138, Line 64] We die, and we live, and we are not resur-rected.  
[Page 138, Line 65] 38. He is nothing but a man, m aking up lies 
[Page 138, Line 66] about Allah. We have no faith in him.”  
[Page 138, Line 67] 39. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have 
[Page 138, Line 68] rejected me.”  
[Page 138, Line 69] 40. He said, “Soon they will be filled with re-
[Page 138, Line 70] gret.”  
[Page 138, Line 71] 41. Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and 
[Page 138, Line 72] We turned them into scum. So away with the wicked people.  
[Page 138, Line 73] 42. Then, after them, We raised other genera-
[Page 138, Line 74] tions.  
[Page 138, Line 75] 43. No nation can advance its time, nor can 
[Page 138, Line 76] they postpone it.  
[Page 138, Line 77] 127 
[Page 139, Line 1] 23.  THE BELIEVERS   (al-Mu’minun)  
[Page 139, Line 2] 44. Then We sent Our messengers in succes-
[Page 139, Line 3] sion. Every time a messenger came to his 
[Page 139, Line 4] community, they called him a liar. So We 
[Page 139, Line 5] mad e them follow one another, and made 
[Page 139, Line 6] them history. So away with a people who do not believe.  
[Page 139, Line 7] 45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aa-
[Page 139, Line 8] ron, with Our signs and a clear authority.  
[Page 139, Line 9] 46. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned 
[Page 139, Line 10] arrogant. They were oppressive pe ople.  
[Page 139, Line 11] 47. They said, “Are we to believe in two mor-
[Page 139, Line 12] tals like us, and their people are our slaves?”  
[Page 139, Line 13] 48. So they called them liars, and thus were 
[Page 139, Line 14] among those destroyed.  
[Page 139, Line 15] 49. And We gave Moses the Scripture, that 
[Page 139, Line 16] they may be guided.  
[Page 139, Line 17] 50. And We made Mary’s son a nd his mother 
[Page 139, Line 18] a sign, and We sheltered them on high 
[Page 139, Line 19] ground with security and flowing springs.  
[Page 139, Line 20] 51. O messengers, eat of the good things, and 
[Page 139, Line 21] act with integrity. I am aware of what you do.  
[Page 139, Line 22] 52. This nation of yours is one nation, and I 
[Page 139, Line 23] am your Lord, so fear M e. 
[Page 139, Line 24] 53. But they tore themselves into sects; each 
[Page 139, Line 25] party happy with what they have.  
[Page 139, Line 26] 54. So leave them in their bewilderment until 
[Page 139, Line 27] a time.  
[Page 139, Line 28] 55. Do they assume that, in furnishing them 
[Page 139, Line 29] with wealth and children.  
[Page 139, Line 30] 56. We race to give them the good things? In 
[Page 139, Line 31] fact, they have no idea.  
[Page 139, Line 32] 57. Those who, from awe of their Lord, are 
[Page 139, Line 33] fearful.  
[Page 139, Line 34] 58. And those who believe in their Lord’s 
[Page 139, Line 35] Verses.  
[Page 139, Line 36] 59. And those who associate no partners with 
[Page 139, Line 37] their Lord.  
[Page 139, Line 38] 60. And those who give what they give, while 
[Page 139, Line 39] their hearts quake, knowing that  to their Lord 
[Page 139, Line 40] they will return.  
[Page 139, Line 41] 61. It is they who race towards goodness. It is 
[Page 139, Line 42] they who will reach it first.  62. We never burden any soul beyond its ca-
[Page 139, Line 43] pacity. And with Us is a record that tells the truth, and they will not be wronged.  
[Page 139, Line 44] 63. But their heart s are puzzled because of this; 
[Page 139, Line 45] and they have deeds that do not conform to 
[Page 139, Line 46] this, which they continue to perpetrate.  
[Page 139, Line 47] 64. Until, when We seize the decadent among 
[Page 139, Line 48] them with torment, they begin to groan.  
[Page 139, Line 49] 65. Do not groan today. You will receive no 
[Page 139, Line 50] help from Us.  
[Page 139, Line 51] 66. My Verses were recited to you, but you 
[Page 139, Line 52] turned back on your heels.  
[Page 139, Line 53] 67. Arrogant towards it— talked nonsense 
[Page 139, Line 54] about it —disregarded it.  
[Page 139, Line 55] 68. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has 
[Page 139, Line 56] there come to them what came not to their 
[Page 139, Line 57] forefathers of old?  
[Page 139, Line 58] 69. Or is it t hat they did not recognize their 
[Page 139, Line 59] messenger, so they are denying him?  
[Page 139, Line 60] 70. Or do they say, “He is possessed?” In fact, 
[Page 139, Line 61] he brought them the truth, but most of them hate the truth.  
[Page 139, Line 62] 71. If the truth conformed to their desires, the 
[Page 139, Line 63] heavens, the earth, and everyo ne in them 
[Page 139, Line 64] would have gone to ruin. In fact, We have 
[Page 139, Line 65] given them their message, but they keep 
[Page 139, Line 66] avoiding their message.  
[Page 139, Line 67] 72. Or are you asking them for a payment? The 
[Page 139, Line 68] revenue from your Lord is better, and He is 
[Page 139, Line 69] the Best of providers.  
[Page 139, Line 70] 73. You are inviting them to a straight path.  
[Page 139, Line 71] 74. But those who do not believe in the Here-
[Page 139, Line 72] after are swerving from the path.  
[Page 139, Line 73] 75. Even if We had mercy on them, and re-
[Page 139, Line 74] lieved their problems, they would still blindly persist in their defiance.  
[Page 139, Line 75] 76. We have already gripped them with suffer-
[Page 139, Line 76] ing, but they did not surrender to their Lord, 
[Page 139, Line 77] nor did they humble themselves.  
[Page 139, Line 78] 77. Until, when We have opened before them 
[Page 139, Line 79] a gate of intense agony, at once they will des-
[Page 139, Line 80] pair.  
[Page 139, Line 81] 128 
[Page 140, Line 1] 23.  THE BELIEVERS   (al-Mu’minun)  
[Page 140, Line 2] 78. It is He who produced for you the hearing, 
[Page 140, Line 3] and the eyesight, and the feelings . But little 
[Page 140, Line 4] gratitude you show.  
[Page 140, Line 5] 79. And it is He who multiplied you on earth, 
[Page 140, Line 6] and to Him you will be gathered.  
[Page 140, Line 7] 80. And it is He who gives life and brings 
[Page 140, Line 8] death, and to Him is the alternation of night 
[Page 140, Line 9] and day. Do you not understand?  
[Page 140, Line 10] 81. But they say the li ke of what the ancients 
[Page 140, Line 11] said.  
[Page 140, Line 12] 82. They say, “After we have died, and become 
[Page 140, Line 13] dust and bones, will we be resurrected?  
[Page 140, Line 14] 83. We were promised this before— we and 
[Page 140, Line 15] our ancestors —these are nothing but legends 
[Page 140, Line 16] of the ancients.”  
[Page 140, Line 17] 84. Say, “To whom does the earth belon g, and 
[Page 140, Line 18] everyone in it, if you happen to know?”  
[Page 140, Line 19] 85. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you 
[Page 140, Line 20] not reflect?”  
[Page 140, Line 21] 86. Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, 
[Page 140, Line 22] and Lord of the Splendid Throne?”  
[Page 140, Line 23] 87. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you 
[Page 140, Line 24] not become righteous?”  
[Page 140, Line 25] 88. Say, “In whose hand is the dominion of all 
[Page 140, Line 26] things, and He protects and cannot be pro-
[Page 140, Line 27] tected from, if you happen to know?”  
[Page 140, Line 28] 89. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then are 
[Page 140, Line 29] you bewitched?”  
[Page 140, Line 30] 90. In fact, We have given them the truth, and 
[Page 140, Line 31] they are l iars. 
[Page 140, Line 32] 91. Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there 
[Page 140, Line 33] any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god 
[Page 140, Line 34] would have taken away what it has created, 
[Page 140, Line 35] and some of them would have gained su-
[Page 140, Line 36] premacy over others. Glory be to Allah, far 
[Page 140, Line 37] beyond what they describe.  
[Page 140, Line 38] 92. The K nower of the hidden and the mani-
[Page 140, Line 39] fest. He is exalted, far above what they asso-ciate.  
[Page 140, Line 40] 93. Say, “My Lord, if You would show me what 
[Page 140, Line 41] they are promised.  
[Page 140, Line 42] 94. My Lord, do not place me among the 
[Page 140, Line 43] wicked people.”  95. We are surely Able to show you what We 
[Page 140, Line 44] promise th em. 
[Page 140, Line 45] 96. Repel evil by what is better. We are aware 
[Page 140, Line 46] of what they describe.  
[Page 140, Line 47] 97. And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You 
[Page 140, Line 48] from the urgings of the devils.  
[Page 140, Line 49] 98. And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest 
[Page 140, Line 50] they become present.”  
[Page 140, Line 51] 99. Until, when death comes to one of them, 
[Page 140, Line 52] he says, “My Lord, send me back.  
[Page 140, Line 53] 100. That I may do right in what I have ne-
[Page 140, Line 54] glected.” By no means! It is just a word that 
[Page 140, Line 55] he utters. And behind them is a barrier, until 
[Page 140, Line 56] the Day they are resurrected.  
[Page 140, Line 57] 101. When the Horn is blown, no relations be-
[Page 140, Line 58] tween them will exist on that Day, and they 
[Page 140, Line 59] will not ask after one another.  
[Page 140, Line 60] 102. Those whose scales are heavy —those are 
[Page 140, Line 61] the successful.  
[Page 140, Line 62] 103. But those whose scales are light —those are 
[Page 140, Line 63] they who have lost their souls; in Hell they 
[Page 140, Line 64] will dwell forever.  
[Page 140, Line 65] 104. The Fire lashes their faces, and therein 
[Page 140, Line 66] they grimace.  
[Page 140, Line 67] 105. “Were not My revelations recited to you, 
[Page 140, Line 68] and you kept on rejecting them?”  
[Page 140, Line 69] 106. They will say, “Our Lord, our wretched-
[Page 140, Line 70] ness prevailed over us, and we were a people 
[Page 140, Line 71] astray.  
[Page 140, Line 72] 107. Our Lord! Bring us out of thi s. If we ever 
[Page 140, Line 73] returned, we would truly be evil.”  
[Page 140, Line 74] 108. He will say, “Be despised therein, and do 
[Page 140, Line 75] not speak to Me.  
[Page 140, Line 76] 109. There was a group of My servants who 
[Page 140, Line 77] would say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so 
[Page 140, Line 78] forgive us, and have mercy on us; You are the 
[Page 140, Line 79] Best of the merciful.'  
[Page 140, Line 80] 110. But you made them a target of ridicule, 
[Page 140, Line 81] until they made you forget My remembrance; and you used to laugh at them.  
[Page 140, Line 82] 111. Today, I have rewarded them for their en-
[Page 140, Line 83] durance. They are the ones who are the tri-
[Page 140, Line 84] umphant.”  
[Page 140, Line 85] 129 
[Page 141, Line 1] 24.  THE LIGHT   (an-Nur)  
[Page 141, Line 2] 112. He will say, “How many y ears did you re-
[Page 141, Line 3] main on earth?”  
[Page 141, Line 4] 113. They will say, “We remained a day, or part 
[Page 141, Line 5] of a day; but ask those who keep count.”  
[Page 141, Line 6] 114. He will say, “You remained only for a little 
[Page 141, Line 7] while, if you only knew.  
[Page 141, Line 8] 115. Did you think that We created you in vain, 
[Page 141, Line 9] and that to Us you will not be returned?”  
[Page 141, Line 10] 116. So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real. 
[Page 141, Line 11] There is no god except He, the Lord of the 
[Page 141, Line 12] Noble Throne.  
[Page 141, Line 13] 117. Whoever invokes another god besides Al-
[Page 141, Line 14] lah—he has no proof thereof —his reckoning 
[Page 141, Line 15] rests with his Lord. The disbelievers  will not 
[Page 141, Line 16] succeed.  
[Page 141, Line 17] 118. And say, “My Lord, forgive and have 
[Page 141, Line 18] mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful.”  

[Page 141, Line 20] 24. THE LIGHT  
[Page 141, Line 21] (an-Nur)  
[Page 141, Line 22] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 141, Line 23] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 141, Line 24] 1. A chapter that We have revealed, and made 
[Page 141, Line 25] obligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses, 
[Page 141, Line 26] that you may take heed.  
[Page 141, Line 27] 2. The adulteress and the adulterer —whip 
[Page 141, Line 28] each one of them a hundred lashes, and let no pity towards them overcome you regarding 
[Page 141, Line 29] Allah’s Law, if you believe in Allah and the 
[Page 141, Line 30] Last Day. And let a group of believers witnes s 
[Page 141, Line 31] their punishment.  
[Page 141, Line 32] 3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul-
[Page 141, Line 33] teress or an idolatress; and the adulteress 
[Page 141, Line 34] shall marry none but an adulterer or an idol-ater. That has been prohibited for the believ-
[Page 141, Line 35] ers. 
[Page 141, Line 36] 4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can-
[Page 141, Line 37] not bring f our witnesses, whip them eighty 
[Page 141, Line 38] lashes, and do not ever accept their testi-
[Page 141, Line 39] mony. For these are the immoral.  
[Page 141, Line 40] 5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and 
[Page 141, Line 41] reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  6. As for those who accuse their own spouses, 
[Page 141, Line 42] but have no  witnesses except themselves, the 
[Page 141, Line 43] testimony of one of them is equivalent to four testimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is 
[Page 141, Line 44] truthful.  
[Page 141, Line 45] 7. And the fifth time, that Allah’s curse be 
[Page 141, Line 46] upon him, if he is a liar.  
[Page 141, Line 47] 8. But punishment shall be averted from her, 
[Page 141, Line 48] if she swears four times by Allah, that he is a 
[Page 141, Line 49] liar. 
[Page 141, Line 50] 9. And the fifth time, that Allah’s wrath be 
[Page 141, Line 51] upon her, if he is truthful.  
[Page 141, Line 52] 10. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and 
[Page 141, Line 53] His mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and 
[Page 141, Line 54] Wise.  
[Page 141, Line 55] 11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a 
[Page 141, Line 56] band of you. Do not consider it bad for you, 
[Page 141, Line 57] but it is good for you. Each person among them bears his share in the sin. As for him 
[Page 141, Line 58] who played the major role —for him is a ter-
[Page 141, Line 59] rible punishment.  
[Page 141, Line 60] 12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ-
[Page 141, Line 61] ing men  and women did not think well of one 
[Page 141, Line 62] another, and say, “This is an obvious lie”?  
[Page 141, Line 63] 13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to 
[Page 141, Line 64] testify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses, 
[Page 141, Line 65] then in Allah’s sight, they are liars.  
[Page 141, Line 66] 14. Were it not for Allah’s favor upon you, and 
[Page 141, Line 67] His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, 
[Page 141, Line 68] you would have suffered a great punishment 
[Page 141, Line 69] for what you have ventured into.  
[Page 141, Line 70] 15. When you rumored it with your tongues, 
[Page 141, Line 71] and spoke with your mouths what you had no 
[Page 141, Line 72] knowledge of, and you considered it trivi al; 
[Page 141, Line 73] but according to Allah, it is serious.  
[Page 141, Line 74] 16. When you heard it, you should have said, 
[Page 141, Line 75] “It is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory, 
[Page 141, Line 76] this is a serious slander.”  
[Page 141, Line 77] 17. Allah cautions you never to return to the 
[Page 141, Line 78] like of it, if you are believers.  
[Page 141, Line 79] 18. Allah explains the Verses to you. Allah is 
[Page 141, Line 80] Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 141, Line 81] 19. Those who love to see immorality spread 
[Page 141, Line 82] among the believers —for them is a painful 
[Page 141, Line 83] 130 
[Page 142, Line 1] 24.  THE LIGHT   (an-Nur)  
[Page 142, Line 2] punishment, in this life and in the Hereafter. 
[Page 142, Line 3] Allah knows, and you do not know.  
[Page 142, Line 4] 20. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and 
[Page 142, Line 5] His mercy, and that Allah is Clement and 
[Page 142, Line 6] Merciful.  
[Page 142, Line 7] 21. O you who believe! Do not follow Satan’s 
[Page 142, Line 8] footsteps. Whoever follows Satan’s foot-
[Page 142, Line 9] steps —he advocates obscenity and immoral-
[Page 142, Line 10] ity. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, 
[Page 142, Line 11] and His mercy, not one of you would have 
[Page 142, Line 12] been pure, ever. But Allah purifies whomever 
[Page 142, Line 13] He wills. Allah is All- Hearing, All -Knowing.  
[Page 142, Line 14] 22. Those of you who have affluence and 
[Page 142, Line 15] means should not refuse to give to the rela-
[Page 142, Line 16] tives, and the needy, and the emigrants for 
[Page 142, Line 17] the sake of Allah. And let them pardon, and 
[Page 142, Line 18] let them overlook. Do you not love for Allah 
[Page 142, Line 19] to pardon you? Allah is All -Forgiving, Most 
[Page 142, Line 20] Merciful.  
[Page 142, Line 21] 23. Those who slander honorable, innocent, 
[Page 142, Line 22] believing women are cursed in this life and in 
[Page 142, Line 23] the Hereafter. They will have a terrible pun-
[Page 142, Line 24] ishment.  
[Page 142, Line 25] 24. On the Day when their tongues, and their 
[Page 142, Line 26] hands, and their feet will testify against them 
[Page 142, Line 27] regarding what they used to do.  
[Page 142, Line 28] 25. On that Day, Allah will pay them their ac-
[Page 142, Line 29] count in full, and they will know that Allah is 
[Page 142, Line 30] the Evident Reality.  
[Page 142, Line 31] 26. Bad women are for bad men, and bad men 
[Page 142, Line 32] are for bad women, and good women are for 
[Page 142, Line 33] good men, and good men are for good women. Those are acquitted of what they say. 
[Page 142, Line 34] There is forgiveness for them, and a generous 
[Page 142, Line 35] provision.  
[Page 142, Line 36] 27. O you who believe! Do not enter h omes 
[Page 142, Line 37] other than your own, until you have asked 
[Page 142, Line 38] permission and greeted their occupants. That 
[Page 142, Line 39] is better for you, that you may be aware.  
[Page 142, Line 40] 28. And if you find no one in them, do not en-
[Page 142, Line 41] ter them until you are given permission. And 
[Page 142, Line 42] if it is said to you, “Turn back ,” then turn 
[Page 142, Line 43] back. That is more proper for you. Allah is 
[Page 142, Line 44] aware of what you do.  29. There is no blame on you for entering un-
[Page 142, Line 45] inhabited houses, in which are belongings of 
[Page 142, Line 46] yours. Allah knows what you reveal and what 
[Page 142, Line 47] you conceal.  
[Page 142, Line 48] 30. Tell the believing men to r estrain their 
[Page 142, Line 49] looks, and to guard their privates. That is 
[Page 142, Line 50] purer for them. Allah is cognizant of what 
[Page 142, Line 51] they do.  
[Page 142, Line 52] 31. And tell the believing women to restrain 
[Page 142, Line 53] their looks, and to guard their privates, and 
[Page 142, Line 54] not display their beauty except what is appar-
[Page 142, Line 55] ent thereo f, and to draw their coverings over 
[Page 142, Line 56] their breasts, and not expose their beauty ex-
[Page 142, Line 57] cept to their husbands, their fathers, their 
[Page 142, Line 58] husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' 
[Page 142, Line 59] sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their 
[Page 142, Line 60] sisters' sons, their women, what their right 
[Page 142, Line 61] hands possess, their male attendants who have no sexual desires, or children who are 
[Page 142, Line 62] not yet aware of the nakedness of women. 
[Page 142, Line 63] And they should not strike their feet to draw 
[Page 142, Line 64] attention to their hidden beauty. And repent 
[Page 142, Line 65] to Allah, all of you believ ers, so that you may 
[Page 142, Line 66] succeed.  
[Page 142, Line 67] 32. And wed the singles among you, and those 
[Page 142, Line 68] who are fit among your servants and maids. 
[Page 142, Line 69] If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from 
[Page 142, Line 70] His bounty. Allah is All -Encompassing, All -
[Page 142, Line 71] Knowing.  
[Page 142, Line 72] 33. And let those who do not find the me ans to 
[Page 142, Line 73] marry abstain, until Allah enriches them from His bounty. If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you rec-
[Page 142, Line 74] ognize some good in them. And give them of 
[Page 142, Line 75] Allah’s wealth which he has given you. And 
[Page 142, Line 76] do not compel your girls to pr ostitution, 
[Page 142, Line 77] seeking the materials of this life, if they desire 
[Page 142, Line 78] to remain chaste. Should anyone compel 
[Page 142, Line 79] them —after their compulsion, Allah is For-
[Page 142, Line 80] giving and Merciful.  
[Page 142, Line 81] 34. We have sent down to you clarifying reve-
[Page 142, Line 82] lations, and examples of those who passed on 
[Page 142, Line 83] before you, and advice for the righteous.  
[Page 142, Line 84] 35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the 
[Page 142, Line 85] earth. The allegory of His light is that of a pil-
[Page 142, Line 86] lar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a glass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled 
[Page 142, Line 87] 131 
[Page 143, Line 1] 24.  THE LIGHT   (an-Nur)  
[Page 143, Line 2] by a blessed tree, an oli ve tree, neither eastern 
[Page 143, Line 3] nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, 
[Page 143, Line 4] even if no fire has touched it. Light upon 
[Page 143, Line 5] Light. Allah guides to His light whomever He 
[Page 143, Line 6] wills. Allah thus cites the parables for the peo-
[Page 143, Line 7] ple. Allah is cognizant of everything.  
[Page 143, Line 8] 36. In hou ses which Allah has permitted to be 
[Page 143, Line 9] raised, and His name is celebrated therein. 
[Page 143, Line 10] He is glorified therein, morning and evening.  
[Page 143, Line 11] 37. By men who neither trading nor commerce 
[Page 143, Line 12] distracts them from Allah’s remembrance, 
[Page 143, Line 13] and from performing the prayers, and from giving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and 
[Page 143, Line 14] sights are overturned.  
[Page 143, Line 15] 38. Allah will reward them according to the 
[Page 143, Line 16] best of what they did, and He will increase 
[Page 143, Line 17] them from His bounty. Allah provides for 
[Page 143, Line 18] whomever He wills without reckoning.  
[Page 143, Line 19] 39. As for those who disb elieve, their works are 
[Page 143, Line 20] like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty assumes 
[Page 143, Line 21] it is to be water. Until, when he has reached 
[Page 143, Line 22] it, he finds it to be nothing, but there he finds 
[Page 143, Line 23] Allah, Who settles his account in full. Allah is 
[Page 143, Line 24] swift in reckoning.  
[Page 143, Line 25] 40. Or like utter da rkness in a vast ocean, cov-
[Page 143, Line 26] ered by waves, above which are waves, above 
[Page 143, Line 27] which is fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he brings out his hand, he will hardly see it. He 
[Page 143, Line 28] to whom Allah has not granted a light has no 
[Page 143, Line 29] light.  
[Page 143, Line 30] 41. Do you not realize that Allah is glori fied by 
[Page 143, Line 31] whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and 
[Page 143, Line 32] even by the birds in formation? Each knows 
[Page 143, Line 33] its prayer and its manner of praise. Allah 
[Page 143, Line 34] knows well what they do.  
[Page 143, Line 35] 42. To Allah belongs the dominion of the 
[Page 143, Line 36] heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the ul-timat e return.  
[Page 143, Line 37] 43. Have you not seen how Allah propels the 
[Page 143, Line 38] clouds, then brings them together, then piles 
[Page 143, Line 39] them into a heap, and you see rain drops 
[Page 143, Line 40] emerging from its midst? How He brings 
[Page 143, Line 41] down loads of hail from the sky, striking with 
[Page 143, Line 42] it whomever He wills, and div erting it from 
[Page 143, Line 43] whomever He wills? The flash of its lighten-
[Page 143, Line 44] ing almost snatches the sight away.  44. Allah alternates the night and the day. In 
[Page 143, Line 45] that is a lesson for those who have insight.  
[Page 143, Line 46] 45. Allah created every living creature from 
[Page 143, Line 47] water. Some of them crawl  on their bellies, 
[Page 143, Line 48] and some walk on two feet, and others walk 
[Page 143, Line 49] on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Al-lah is Capable of everything.  
[Page 143, Line 50] 46. We sent down enlightening revelations, 
[Page 143, Line 51] and Allah guides whomever He wills to a 
[Page 143, Line 52] straight path.  
[Page 143, Line 53] 47. And they say, “We have believed in Allah 
[Page 143, Line 54] and the Messenger, and we obey,” but some 
[Page 143, Line 55] of them turn away afterwards. These are not 
[Page 143, Line 56] believers.  
[Page 143, Line 57] 48. And when they are called to Allah and His 
[Page 143, Line 58] Messenger, in order to judge between them, some of them refuse.  
[Page 143, Line 59] 49. But if justice is on t heir side, they accept it 
[Page 143, Line 60] willingly.  
[Page 143, Line 61] 50. Is there sickness in their hearts? Or are they 
[Page 143, Line 62] suspicious? Or do they fear that Allah may do 
[Page 143, Line 63] them injustice? Or His Messenger? In fact, 
[Page 143, Line 64] they themselves are the unjust.  
[Page 143, Line 65] 51. The response of the believers, when they 
[Page 143, Line 66] are called to Allah and His Messenger in or-
[Page 143, Line 67] der to judge between them, is to say, “We hear and we obey.” These are the successful.  
[Page 143, Line 68] 52. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, 
[Page 143, Line 69] and fears Allah, and is conscious of Him —
[Page 143, Line 70] these are the winners.  
[Page 143, Line 71] 53. And they swear by  Allah with their solemn 
[Page 143, Line 72] oaths, that if you commanded them, they 
[Page 143, Line 73] would mobilize. Say, “Do not swear. Obedi-
[Page 143, Line 74] ence will be recognized. Allah is experienced 
[Page 143, Line 75] with what you do.”  
[Page 143, Line 76] 54. Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.” 
[Page 143, Line 77] But if they turn away, then he is respo nsible 
[Page 143, Line 78] for his obligations, and you are responsible 
[Page 143, Line 79] for your obligations. And if you obey him, 
[Page 143, Line 80] you will be guided. It is only incumbent on 
[Page 143, Line 81] the Messenger to deliver the Clarifying Mes-
[Page 143, Line 82] sage.  
[Page 143, Line 83] 55. Allah has promised those of you who be-
[Page 143, Line 84] lieve and do righteous deeds, that He will 
[Page 143, Line 85] make them successors on earth, as He made 
[Page 143, Line 86] 132 
[Page 144, Line 1] 25.  THE CRITERION   (al-Furqan)  
[Page 144, Line 2] those before them successors, and He will es-
[Page 144, Line 3] tablish for them their religion —which He has 
[Page 144, Line 4] approved for them —and He will substitute 
[Page 144, Line 5] security in place of their fear. They worship Me, never associating  anything with Me. But 
[Page 144, Line 6] whoever disbelieves after that —these are the 
[Page 144, Line 7] sinners.  
[Page 144, Line 8] 56. Pray regularly, and give regular charity, 
[Page 144, Line 9] and obey the Messenger, so that you may re-ceive mercy.  
[Page 144, Line 10] 57. Never think that those who disbelieve can 
[Page 144, Line 11] escape on earth. Their place is the Fire; a mis-
[Page 144, Line 12] erable destination.  
[Page 144, Line 13] 58. O you who believe! Permission must be re-
[Page 144, Line 14] quested by your servants and those of you 
[Page 144, Line 15] who have not reached puberty. On three oc-casions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon 
[Page 144, Line 16] when you change your clothes, and after the 
[Page 144, Line 17] Eveni ng Prayer. These are three occasions of 
[Page 144, Line 18] privacy for you. At other times, it is not 
[Page 144, Line 19] wrong for you or them to intermingle with 
[Page 144, Line 20] one another. Allah thus clarifies the revela-
[Page 144, Line 21] tions for you. Allah is Knowledgeable and 
[Page 144, Line 22] Wise.  
[Page 144, Line 23] 59. When the children among you reach p u-
[Page 144, Line 24] berty, they must ask permission, as those be-
[Page 144, Line 25] fore them asked permission. Allah thus clari-
[Page 144, Line 26] fies His revelations for you. Allah is Knowl-
[Page 144, Line 27] edgeable and Wise.  
[Page 144, Line 28] 60. Women past the age of childbearing, who 
[Page 144, Line 29] have no desire for marriage, commit no 
[Page 144, Line 30] wrong by taking off t heir outer clothing, pro-
[Page 144, Line 31] vided they do not flaunt their finery. But to 
[Page 144, Line 32] maintain modesty is better for them. Allah is 
[Page 144, Line 33] Hearing and Knowing.  
[Page 144, Line 34] 61. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
[Page 144, Line 35] blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, 
[Page 144, Line 36] nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, 
[Page 144, Line 37] or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sis-
[Page 144, Line 38] ters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal 
[Page 144, Line 39] uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, 
[Page 144, Line 40] or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal a unts, or those 
[Page 144, Line 41] whose keys you own, or the homes of your friends. You commit no wrong by eating to-
[Page 144, Line 42] gether or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a greeting from 
[Page 144, Line 43] Allah, blessed and good. Allah thus explains 
[Page 144, Line 44] the revelations for you,  so that you may un-
[Page 144, Line 45] derstand.  
[Page 144, Line 46] 62. The believers are those who believe in Al-
[Page 144, Line 47] lah and His Messenger, and when they are 
[Page 144, Line 48] with him for a matter of common interest, 
[Page 144, Line 49] they do not leave until they have asked him 
[Page 144, Line 50] for permission. Those who ask your permis-
[Page 144, Line 51] sion are those  who believe in Allah and His 
[Page 144, Line 52] Messenger. So when they ask your permis-
[Page 144, Line 53] sion to attend to some affair of theirs, give 
[Page 144, Line 54] permission to any of them you wish, and ask 
[Page 144, Line 55] Allah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv-
[Page 144, Line 56] ing and Merciful.  
[Page 144, Line 57] 63. Do not address the Messenger i n the same 
[Page 144, Line 58] manner you address one another. Allah 
[Page 144, Line 59] knows those of you who slip away using flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his 
[Page 144, Line 60] orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or 
[Page 144, Line 61] a painful punishment befalls them.  
[Page 144, Line 62] 64. Surely, to Allah belongs everything in  the 
[Page 144, Line 63] heavens and the earth. He knows what you 
[Page 144, Line 64] are about. And on the Day they are returned 
[Page 144, Line 65] to Him, He will inform them of what they 
[Page 144, Line 66] did. Allah has full knowledge of all things.  

[Page 144, Line 68] 25. THE CRITERION  
[Page 144, Line 69] (al-Furqan)  
[Page 144, Line 70] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 144, Line 71] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 144, Line 72] 1. Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion 
[Page 144, Line 73] upon His servant, to be a warning to human-
[Page 144, Line 74] ity. 
[Page 144, Line 75] 2. He to whom belongs the kingdom of the 
[Page 144, Line 76] heavens and the earth, who took to Himself no son, who never had a partner in His king-
[Page 144, Line 77] ship; who created everything and det ermined 
[Page 144, Line 78] its measure.  
[Page 144, Line 79] 3. And yet, instead of Him, they produce for 
[Page 144, Line 80] themselves gods that create nothing, but are 
[Page 144, Line 81] themselves created; that have no power to 
[Page 144, Line 82] harm or benefit themselves; and no power 
[Page 144, Line 83] over life, death, or resurrection.  
[Page 144, Line 84] 133 
[Page 145, Line 1] 25.  THE CRITERION   (al-Furqan)  
[Page 145, Line 2] 4. Those who disbelieve say, “This is nothing 
[Page 145, Line 3] but a lie that he made up, and others have 
[Page 145, Line 4] helped him at it.” They have committed an 
[Page 145, Line 5] injustice and a perjury.  
[Page 145, Line 6] 5. And they say, “Tales of the ancients; he 
[Page 145, Line 7] wrote them down; they are dictated to him 
[Page 145, Line 8] morning and evening.”  
[Page 145, Line 9] 6. Say, “It was revealed by He who knows the 
[Page 145, Line 10] Secret in the heavens and the earth. He is al-
[Page 145, Line 11] ways Forgiving and Merciful.”  
[Page 145, Line 12] 7. And they say, “What sort of messenger is 
[Page 145, Line 13] this, who eats food, and walks in the market-
[Page 145, Line 14] places? If only an angel was sent down with 
[Page 145, Line 15] him, to be alongside  him a warner.”  
[Page 145, Line 16] 8. Or, “If only a treasure was dropped on 
[Page 145, Line 17] him.” Or, “If only he had a garden from 
[Page 145, Line 18] which he eats.” The evildoers also say, “You 
[Page 145, Line 19] are following but a man under spell.”  
[Page 145, Line 20] 9. Look how they invent examples for you. 
[Page 145, Line 21] They have gone astray, and cannot  find a 
[Page 145, Line 22] way.  
[Page 145, Line 23] 10. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can provide 
[Page 145, Line 24] you with better than that— gardens beneath 
[Page 145, Line 25] which rivers flow —and He will give you pal-
[Page 145, Line 26] aces.  
[Page 145, Line 27] 11. In fact, they have denied the Hour, and We 
[Page 145, Line 28] have prepared for those who deny the Hour a 
[Page 145, Line 29] Blaze.  
[Page 145, Line 30] 12. Whe n it sees them from a distant place, 
[Page 145, Line 31] they will hear it raging and roaring.  
[Page 145, Line 32] 13. And when they are thrown into it, into a 
[Page 145, Line 33] tight place, shackled, they will plead there for 
[Page 145, Line 34] death.  
[Page 145, Line 35] 14. “Do not plead for one death today, but 
[Page 145, Line 36] plead for a great many deaths.”  
[Page 145, Line 37] 15. Say, “Is this better, or the Garden of Eter-
[Page 145, Line 38] nity promised to the righteous? It is for them 
[Page 145, Line 39] a reward and a destination.  
[Page 145, Line 40] 16. They will have therein whatever they de-
[Page 145, Line 41] sire, forever. That is upon your Lord a bind-
[Page 145, Line 42] ing promise.  
[Page 145, Line 43] 17. On the Day when He gathers them, and 
[Page 145, Line 44] what they worshiped besides Allah, He will say, “Was it you who misled these servants of Mine, or was it they who lost the way?”  
[Page 145, Line 45] 18. They will say, “Glory be to You. It was not 
[Page 145, Line 46] for us to take any lords besides You. But you 
[Page 145, Line 47] gave them enjoyments, and their  ancestors, 
[Page 145, Line 48] until they forgot the Message, and became ru-
[Page 145, Line 49] ined people.”  
[Page 145, Line 50] 19. They have denied you because of what you 
[Page 145, Line 51] say; so you can neither avert, nor help. Who-
[Page 145, Line 52] ever among you commits injustice, We will 
[Page 145, Line 53] make him taste a grievous punishment.  
[Page 145, Line 54] 20. We never sent  any messengers before you, 
[Page 145, Line 55] but they ate food and walked in the market-
[Page 145, Line 56] places. And We made some of you tempters 
[Page 145, Line 57] for one another —will you be patient? Your 
[Page 145, Line 58] Lord is always Observing.  
[Page 145, Line 59] 21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say, 
[Page 145, Line 60] “If only the angels were sent dow n to us, or 
[Page 145, Line 61] we could see our Lord.” They have grown ar-
[Page 145, Line 62] rogant within themselves, and have become 
[Page 145, Line 63] excessively defiant.  
[Page 145, Line 64] 22. On the Day when they see the angels —
[Page 145, Line 65] there will be no good news for sinners on that 
[Page 145, Line 66] Day; and they will say, “A protective refuge.”  
[Page 145, Line 67] 23. We will proceed to the works they did, and 
[Page 145, Line 68] will turn them into scattered dust.  
[Page 145, Line 69] 24. The companions of Paradise on that Day 
[Page 145, Line 70] will be better lodged, and more fairly accom-
[Page 145, Line 71] modated.  
[Page 145, Line 72] 25. The Day when the sky is cleft with clouds, 
[Page 145, Line 73] and the angels are sent down in str eams.  
[Page 145, Line 74] 26. On that Day, true sovereignty will belong 
[Page 145, Line 75] to the Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day for the disbelievers.  
[Page 145, Line 76] 27. On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his 
[Page 145, Line 77] hands, and say, “If only I had followed the 
[Page 145, Line 78] way with the Messenger.  
[Page 145, Line 79] 28. Oh, woe to me; I wish I never took so -and-
[Page 145, Line 80] so for a friend.  
[Page 145, Line 81] 29. He led me away from the Message after it 
[Page 145, Line 82] had come to me; for Satan has always been a betrayer of man.”  
[Page 145, Line 83] 30. And the Messenger will say, “My Lord, my 
[Page 145, Line 84] people have abandoned this Quran.”  
[Page 145, Line 85] 134 
[Page 146, Line 1] 25.  THE CRITERION   (al-Furqan)  
[Page 146, Line 2] 31. Likewise, to every prophet We assign ene-
[Page 146, Line 3] mies from among the wicked. But your Lord 
[Page 146, Line 4] suffices as a Guide and Savior.  
[Page 146, Line 5] 32. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was the 
[Page 146, Line 6] Quran not revealed to him at once?” Thus in 
[Page 146, Line 7] order to strengthen your heart thereby, and 
[Page 146, Line 8] We revealed it in stages.  
[Page 146, Line 9] 33. Whatever argument they come to you 
[Page 146, Line 10] with, We provide you with the truth, and a 
[Page 146, Line 11] better exposition.  
[Page 146, Line 12] 34. Those who are herded into Hell on their 
[Page 146, Line 13] faces —those are in a worse position, and fur-
[Page 146, Line 14] ther astray from the way.  
[Page 146, Line 15] 35. We gave Moses the Scripture, and ap-
[Page 146, Line 16] pointe d his brother Aaron as his assistant.  
[Page 146, Line 17] 36. We said, “Go to the people who rejected 
[Page 146, Line 18] Our signs,” and We destroyed them com-pletely.  
[Page 146, Line 19] 37. And the people of Noah: when they re-
[Page 146, Line 20] jected the messengers, We drowned them, 
[Page 146, Line 21] and made them a lesson for mankind. We 
[Page 146, Line 22] have prep ared for the wrongdoers a painful 
[Page 146, Line 23] retribution.  
[Page 146, Line 24] 38. And Aad, and Thamood, and the inhabit-
[Page 146, Line 25] ants of Arras, and many generations in be-
[Page 146, Line 26] tween.  
[Page 146, Line 27] 39. To each We presented the parables; and 
[Page 146, Line 28] each We devastated utterly.  
[Page 146, Line 29] 40. And they came upon the city that was 
[Page 146, Line 30] drenched  by the terrible rain. Did they not 
[Page 146, Line 31] see it? But they do not expect resurrection.  
[Page 146, Line 32] 41. And when they see you, they take you for 
[Page 146, Line 33] nothing but mockery: “Is this the one Allah 
[Page 146, Line 34] sent as a messenger?”  
[Page 146, Line 35] 42. “He nearly led us away from our gods, had 
[Page 146, Line 36] we not patiently adhered to them.” But they will know, when they witness the torment, 
[Page 146, Line 37] who is further away from the way.  
[Page 146, Line 38] 43. Have you seen him who chose his desire as 
[Page 146, Line 39] his god? Would you be an agent for him?  
[Page 146, Line 40] 44. Or do you assume that most of them hear 
[Page 146, Line 41] or understand? They are just like cattle, but 
[Page 146, Line 42] even more errant in their way.  45. Do you not see how your Lord extends the 
[Page 146, Line 43] shadow? Had He willed, He could have made 
[Page 146, Line 44] it still. And We made the sun a pointer to it.  
[Page 146, Line 45] 46. Then We withdraw it towards Us gradu-
[Page 146, Line 46] ally. 
[Page 146, Line 47] 47. And it is He who ma de the night a covering 
[Page 146, Line 48] for you, and sleep for rest; and He made the 
[Page 146, Line 49] day a revival.  
[Page 146, Line 50] 48. And it is He who sends the winds, bringing 
[Page 146, Line 51] advance news of His mercy; and We send 
[Page 146, Line 52] down from the sky pure water.  
[Page 146, Line 53] 49. To revive dead lands thereby, and to pro-
[Page 146, Line 54] vide drink f or the multitude of animals and 
[Page 146, Line 55] humans We created.  
[Page 146, Line 56] 50. We have circulated it among them, that 
[Page 146, Line 57] they may reflect, but most people persist in 
[Page 146, Line 58] thanklessness.  
[Page 146, Line 59] 51. Had We willed, We could have sent to 
[Page 146, Line 60] every town a warner.  
[Page 146, Line 61] 52. So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive 
[Page 146, Line 62] against them with it, a mighty struggle.  
[Page 146, Line 63] 53. And it is He who merged the two seas; this 
[Page 146, Line 64] one fresh and sweet, and that one salty and 
[Page 146, Line 65] bitter; and He placed between them a barrier, 
[Page 146, Line 66] and an impassable boundary.  
[Page 146, Line 67] 54. And it is He who, from fluid, created the 
[Page 146, Line 68] human being. Then He made relationships 
[Page 146, Line 69] through marriage and mating. Your Lord is 
[Page 146, Line 70] Omnipotent.  
[Page 146, Line 71] 55. And yet, instead of Allah, they serve what 
[Page 146, Line 72] neither profits them nor harms them. The 
[Page 146, Line 73] disbeliever has always turned his back on his 
[Page 146, Line 74] Lord.  
[Page 146, Line 75] 56. We sent you only as a herald of good news 
[Page 146, Line 76] and a warner.  
[Page 146, Line 77] 57. Say, “I ask of you no payment for this —
[Page 146, Line 78] only that whoever wills may take a path to his 
[Page 146, Line 79] Lord.”  
[Page 146, Line 80] 58. And put your trust in the Living, the One 
[Page 146, Line 81] who never dies; and celebrate His praise. He 
[Page 146, Line 82] suffices as the All -Infor med Knower of the 
[Page 146, Line 83] faults of His creatures.  
[Page 146, Line 84] 59. He who created the heavens and the earth 
[Page 146, Line 85] and everything between them in six days, 
[Page 146, Line 86] 135 
[Page 147, Line 1] 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
[Page 147, Line 2] then settled on the Throne. The Most Merci-
[Page 147, Line 3] ful. Ask about Him a well -informed.  
[Page 147, Line 4] 60. And when it is said to them, “Bow down to 
[Page 147, Line 5] the Merciful,” they say, “And what is the 
[Page 147, Line 6] Merciful? Are we to bow down to whatever 
[Page 147, Line 7] you command us?” And it increases their aversion.  
[Page 147, Line 8] 61. Blessed is He who placed constellations in 
[Page 147, Line 9] the sky, and placed in it a lamp, and an illu-
[Page 147, Line 10] minating moon.  
[Page 147, Line 11] 62. And it is He wh o made the night and the 
[Page 147, Line 12] day alternate —for whoever desires to reflect, 
[Page 147, Line 13] or desires to show gratitude.  
[Page 147, Line 14] 63. The servants of the Merciful are those who 
[Page 147, Line 15] walk the earth in humility, and when the ig-
[Page 147, Line 16] norant address them, they say, “Peace.”  
[Page 147, Line 17] 64. And those who pass th e night prostrating 
[Page 147, Line 18] themselves to their Lord and standing up.  
[Page 147, Line 19] 65. And those who say, ‘‘Our Lord, avert from 
[Page 147, Line 20] us the suffering of Hell, for its suffering is continuous.  
[Page 147, Line 21] 66. It is indeed a miserable residence and des-
[Page 147, Line 22] tination.”  
[Page 147, Line 23] 67. And those who, when they spe nd, are nei-
[Page 147, Line 24] ther wasteful nor stingy, but choose a middle 
[Page 147, Line 25] course between that.  
[Page 147, Line 26] 68. And those who do not implore besides Al-
[Page 147, Line 27] lah any other god, and do not kill the soul 
[Page 147, Line 28] which Allah has made sacred —except in the 
[Page 147, Line 29] pursuit of justice —and do not commit adul-
[Page 147, Line 30] tery. Wh oever does that will face penalties.  
[Page 147, Line 31] 69. The punishment will be doubled for him 
[Page 147, Line 32] on the Day of Resurrection, and he will dwell 
[Page 147, Line 33] therein in humiliation forever.  
[Page 147, Line 34] 70. Except for those who repent, and believe, 
[Page 147, Line 35] and do good deeds. These —Allah will replace 
[Page 147, Line 36] their ba d deeds with good deeds. Allah is ever 
[Page 147, Line 37] Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 147, Line 38] 71. Whoever repents and acts righteously —
[Page 147, Line 39] has inclined towards Allah with repentance.  
[Page 147, Line 40] 72. And those who do not bear false witness; 
[Page 147, Line 41] and when they come across indecencies, they pass by with dignit y. 73. And those who, when reminded of the rev-
[Page 147, Line 42] elations of their Lord, do not fall before them 
[Page 147, Line 43] deaf and blind.  
[Page 147, Line 44] 74. And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us de-
[Page 147, Line 45] light in our spouses and our children, and 
[Page 147, Line 46] make us a good example for the righteous.”  
[Page 147, Line 47] 75. Those will be awarded the Chamber for 
[Page 147, Line 48] their patience, and will be greeted therein 
[Page 147, Line 49] with greetings and peace.  
[Page 147, Line 50] 76. Abiding therein forever —it is an excellent 
[Page 147, Line 51] residence and destination.  
[Page 147, Line 52] 77. Say, “What are you to my Lord without 
[Page 147, Line 53] your prayers? You have denied the truth, and the inevitable will happen.”  

[Page 147, Line 55] 26. THE POETS  
[Page 147, Line 56] (ash-Shu’ara’ ) 
[Page 147, Line 57] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 147, Line 58] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 147, Line 59] 1. Ta, Seen, Meem.  
[Page 147, Line 60] 2. These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.  
[Page 147, Line 61] 3. Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, 
[Page 147, Line 62] because they do not become believers.  
[Page 147, Line 63] 4. If We will, We can send down upon them a 
[Page 147, Line 64] sign from heaven, at which their necks will 
[Page 147, Line 65] stay bent in humility.  
[Page 147, Line 66] 5. No fresh reminder comes to them from the 
[Page 147, Line 67] Most Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.  
[Page 147, Line 68] 6. They have denied the truth, but soon will 
[Page 147, Line 69] come to them the news of what they ridi-culed.  
[Page 147, Line 70] 7. Have they not seen the earth, and how 
[Page 147, Line 71] many beautiful pairs We produced therein?  
[Page 147, Line 72] 8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are 
[Page 147, Line 73] not believers.  
[Page 147, Line 74] 9. Most surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the 
[Page 147, Line 75] Merciful.  
[Page 147, Line 76] 10. Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the ty-
[Page 147, Line 77] rannical people.  
[Page 147, Line 78] 11. The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”  
[Page 147, Line 79] 136 
[Page 148, Line 1] 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
[Page 148, Line 2] 12. He said, “My Lord, I fear they will reject 
[Page 148, Line 3] me. 
[Page 148, Line 4] 13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is 
[Page 148, Line 5] not fluent, so send Aaron too.  
[Page 148, Line 6] 14. And they have a c harge against me, so I fear 
[Page 148, Line 7] they will kill me.”  
[Page 148, Line 8] 15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our 
[Page 148, Line 9] proofs. We will be with you, listening.  
[Page 148, Line 10] 16. Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Mes-
[Page 148, Line 11] sengers of the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 148, Line 12] 17. Let the Children of Israel go with us.'“  
[Page 148, Line 13] 18. He said, “Did we not raise you among us as 
[Page 148, Line 14] a child, and you stayed among us for many of 
[Page 148, Line 15] your years?  
[Page 148, Line 16] 19. And you committed that deed you com-
[Page 148, Line 17] mitted, and you were ungrateful.”  
[Page 148, Line 18] 20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those 
[Page 148, Line 19] astray.  
[Page 148, Line 20] 21. And I fled from you  when I feared you; but 
[Page 148, Line 21] my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one 
[Page 148, Line 22] of the messengers.  
[Page 148, Line 23] 22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, alt-
[Page 148, Line 24] hough you have enslaved the Children of Is-
[Page 148, Line 25] rael?”  
[Page 148, Line 26] 23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the 
[Page 148, Line 27] Worlds?”  
[Page 148, Line 28] 24. He said, “The Lord o f the heavens and the 
[Page 148, Line 29] earth, and everything between them, if you 
[Page 148, Line 30] are aware.”  
[Page 148, Line 31] 25. He said to those around him, “Do you not 
[Page 148, Line 32] hear?”  
[Page 148, Line 33] 26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your 
[Page 148, Line 34] ancestors of old.”  
[Page 148, Line 35] 27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is 
[Page 148, Line 36] sent to you, is c razy.”  
[Page 148, Line 37] 28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, 
[Page 148, Line 38] and everything between them, if you under-
[Page 148, Line 39] stand.”  
[Page 148, Line 40] 29. He said, “If you accept any god other than 
[Page 148, Line 41] me, I will make you a prisoner.” 
[Page 148, Line 42] 30. He said, “What if I bring you something 
[Page 148, Line 43] convincing?”  31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”  
[Page 148, Line 44] 32. So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, 
[Page 148, Line 45] plain to see.  
[Page 148, Line 46] 33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, 
[Page 148, Line 47] for all to see.  
[Page 148, Line 48] 34. He said to the dignitaries around him, 
[Page 148, Line 49] “This is a skilled magician.  
[Page 148, Line 50] 35. He intends to drive you out of your land 
[Page 148, Line 51] with his magic, so what do you recommend?”  
[Page 148, Line 52] 36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and 
[Page 148, Line 53] send recruiters to the cities.  
[Page 148, Line 54] 37. To bring you every experienced magician.”  
[Page 148, Line 55] 38. So the magicians were gathered for the ap-
[Page 148, Line 56] pointment on a sp ecified day.  
[Page 148, Line 57] 39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all 
[Page 148, Line 58] gathered?  
[Page 148, Line 59] 40. That we may follow the magicians, if they 
[Page 148, Line 60] are the winners.”  
[Page 148, Line 61] 41. When the magicians arrived, they said to 
[Page 148, Line 62] Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are the winners?”  
[Page 148, Line 63] 42. He said, “Ye s, and you will be among those 
[Page 148, Line 64] favored.”  
[Page 148, Line 65] 43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in-
[Page 148, Line 66] tend to present.”  
[Page 148, Line 67] 44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, 
[Page 148, Line 68] and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will 
[Page 148, Line 69] be the winners.”  
[Page 148, Line 70] 45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold , it 
[Page 148, Line 71] began swallowing their trickery.  
[Page 148, Line 72] 46. And the magicians fell down prostrating.  
[Page 148, Line 73] 47. They said, “We have believed in the Lord 
[Page 148, Line 74] of the Worlds.  
[Page 148, Line 75] 48. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”  
[Page 148, Line 76] 49. He said, “Did you believe in Him before I 
[Page 148, Line 77] have given you permission? He mus t be your 
[Page 148, Line 78] chief, who taught you magic. You will soon 
[Page 148, Line 79] know. I will cut off your hands and feet on 
[Page 148, Line 80] opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”  
[Page 148, Line 81] 50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we 
[Page 148, Line 82] will return.  
[Page 148, Line 83] 137 
[Page 149, Line 1] 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
[Page 149, Line 2] 51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our 
[Page 149, Line 3] sins, sinc e we are the first of the believers.”  
[Page 149, Line 4] 52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My 
[Page 149, Line 5] servants by night. You will be followed.”  
[Page 149, Line 6] 53. Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities.  
[Page 149, Line 7] 54. “These are a small gang.  
[Page 149, Line 8] 55. And they are enraging us.  
[Page 149, Line 9] 56. But we are a vigilant multitud e.” 
[Page 149, Line 10] 57. So We drove them out of gardens and 
[Page 149, Line 11] springs.  
[Page 149, Line 12] 58. And treasures and noble dwellings.  
[Page 149, Line 13] 59. So it was. And We made the Children of 
[Page 149, Line 14] Israel inherit them.  
[Page 149, Line 15] 60. And they pursued them at sunrise.  
[Page 149, Line 16] 61. When the two groups sighted each other, 
[Page 149, Line 17] the followers of Moses said, “We are being 
[Page 149, Line 18] overtaken.”  
[Page 149, Line 19] 62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will 
[Page 149, Line 20] guide me.”  
[Page 149, Line 21] 63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with 
[Page 149, Line 22] your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each 
[Page 149, Line 23] part was like a huge hill.  
[Page 149, Line 24] 64. And there We brought the others near.  
[Page 149, Line 25] 65. And We saved Moses and those with him, 
[Page 149, Line 26] all together.  
[Page 149, Line 27] 66. Then We drowned the others.  
[Page 149, Line 28] 67. In that there is a sign, but most of them are 
[Page 149, Line 29] not believers.  
[Page 149, Line 30] 68. Surely, your Lord is the Almighty, the Mer-
[Page 149, Line 31] ciful.  
[Page 149, Line 32] 69. And relate to them the story of Abraham.  
[Page 149, Line 33] 70. When he said to his father and his people, 
[Page 149, Line 34] “What do you worship?”  
[Page 149, Line 35] 71. They said, “We worship idols, and we re-
[Page 149, Line 36] main devoted to them.”  
[Page 149, Line 37] 72. He said, “Do they hear you when you pray?  
[Page 149, Line 38] 73. Or do they benefit you, or harm you?”  
[Page 149, Line 39] 74. They said, “But we found our ancestor s do-
[Page 149, Line 40] ing so.”  75. He said, “Have you considered what you 
[Page 149, Line 41] worship.  
[Page 149, Line 42] 76. You and your ancient ancestors?  
[Page 149, Line 43] 77. They are enemies to me, but not so the 
[Page 149, Line 44] Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 149, Line 45] 78. He who created me, and guides me.  
[Page 149, Line 46] 79. He who feeds me, and waters me.  
[Page 149, Line 47] 80. And when I get sick, He heals me.  
[Page 149, Line 48] 81. He who makes me die, and then revives me.  
[Page 149, Line 49] 82. He who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the 
[Page 149, Line 50] Day of the Reckoning.”  
[Page 149, Line 51] 83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and include 
[Page 149, Line 52] me with the righteous.  
[Page 149, Line 53] 84. And give me a reputation of truth among 
[Page 149, Line 54] the ot hers.  
[Page 149, Line 55] 85. And make me of the inheritors of the Gar-
[Page 149, Line 56] den of Bliss.  
[Page 149, Line 57] 86. And forgive my father —he was one of the 
[Page 149, Line 58] misguided.  
[Page 149, Line 59] 87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they 
[Page 149, Line 60] are resurrected.  
[Page 149, Line 61] 88. The Day when neither wealth nor children 
[Page 149, Line 62] will help.  
[Page 149, Line 63] 89. Except for him who comes to Allah with a 
[Page 149, Line 64] sound heart.”  
[Page 149, Line 65] 90. And Paradise will be brought near for the 
[Page 149, Line 66] righteous.  
[Page 149, Line 67] 91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi-
[Page 149, Line 68] ators.  
[Page 149, Line 69] 92. And it will be said to them, “Where are 
[Page 149, Line 70] those you used to worship?”  
[Page 149, Line 71] 93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help 
[Page 149, Line 72] themselves?”  
[Page 149, Line 73] 94. Then they will be toppled into it, together 
[Page 149, Line 74] with the seducers.  
[Page 149, Line 75] 95. And the soldiers of Satan, all of them.  
[Page 149, Line 76] 96. They will say, as they feud in it.  
[Page 149, Line 77] 97. “By Allah, We were in evident error.  
[Page 149, Line 78] 98. For equating you with the Lord of the 
[Page 149, Line 79] Worlds.  
[Page 149, Line 80] 138 
[Page 150, Line 1] 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
[Page 150, Line 2] 99. No one misled us except the sinners.  
[Page 150, Line 3] 100. Now we have no intercessors.  
[Page 150, Line 4] 101. And no sincere friend.  
[Page 150, Line 5] 102. If only we could have another chance, we 
[Page 150, Line 6] would be among the faithful.”  
[Page 150, Line 7] 103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
[Page 150, Line 8] are not believers . 
[Page 150, Line 9] 104. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 150, Line 10] 105. The people of Noah disbelieved the mes-
[Page 150, Line 11] sengers.  
[Page 150, Line 12] 106. Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you 
[Page 150, Line 13] not fear?  
[Page 150, Line 14] 107. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
[Page 150, Line 15] 108. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 150, Line 16] 109. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay-
[Page 150, Line 17] ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 150, Line 18] 110. So fear Allah, and obey me.”  
[Page 150, Line 19] 111. They said, “Shall we believe in you, when 
[Page 150, Line 20] it is the lowliest who follow you?”  
[Page 150, Line 21] 112. He said, “What do I know about what they 
[Page 150, Line 22] do? 
[Page 150, Line 23] 113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if 
[Page 150, Line 24] you have sense.  
[Page 150, Line 25] 114. And I am not about to drive away the be-
[Page 150, Line 26] lievers.  
[Page 150, Line 27] 115. I am only a clear warner.”  
[Page 150, Line 28] 116. They said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah, 
[Page 150, Line 29] you will be stoned.”  
[Page 150, Line 30] 117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied 
[Page 150, Line 31] me. 
[Page 150, Line 32] 118. So judge between me and them decisively, 
[Page 150, Line 33] and deliver me and the believers who are with 
[Page 150, Line 34] me. 
[Page 150, Line 35] 119. So We delivered him and those with him 
[Page 150, Line 36] in the laden Ark.  
[Page 150, Line 37] 120. Then We drowned the rest.  
[Page 150, Line 38] 121. In that is a sign, but most of them are not 
[Page 150, Line 39] believers.  
[Page 150, Line 40] 122. Your Lord is the  Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 150, Line 41] 123. Aad disbelieved the messengers.  124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do 
[Page 150, Line 42] you not fear?  
[Page 150, Line 43] 125. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
[Page 150, Line 44] 126. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 150, Line 45] 127. I ask of you no payment for this. My pay-
[Page 150, Line 46] ment is only from  the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 150, Line 47] 128. Do you build a monument on every height 
[Page 150, Line 48] for vanity's sake?  
[Page 150, Line 49] 129. And you set up fortresses, hoping to live 
[Page 150, Line 50] forever?  
[Page 150, Line 51] 130. And when you strike, you strike merci-
[Page 150, Line 52] lessly?  
[Page 150, Line 53] 131. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 150, Line 54] 132. And reverence Him, who supplied you 
[Page 150, Line 55] with everything you know.  
[Page 150, Line 56] 133. He supplied you with livestock and chil-
[Page 150, Line 57] dren.  
[Page 150, Line 58] 134. And gardens and springs.  
[Page 150, Line 59] 135. I fear for you the punishment of an awe-
[Page 150, Line 60] some Day.”  
[Page 150, Line 61] 136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether 
[Page 150, Line 62] you lecture us, or do not lecture . 
[Page 150, Line 63] 137. This is nothing but morals of the ancients.  
[Page 150, Line 64] 138. And we will not be punished.” 
[Page 150, Line 65] 139. So they denied him, and We destroyed 
[Page 150, Line 66] them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of 
[Page 150, Line 67] them are not believers.  
[Page 150, Line 68] 140. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 150, Line 69] 141. Thamood d isbelieved the messengers.  
[Page 150, Line 70] 142. When their brother Saleh said to them, 
[Page 150, Line 71] “Do you not fear?  
[Page 150, Line 72] 143. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
[Page 150, Line 73] 144. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 150, Line 74] 145. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
[Page 150, Line 75] ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 150, Line 76] 146. Will you be left secure in what is here?  
[Page 150, Line 77] 147. In gardens and springs?  
[Page 150, Line 78] 148. And fields, and palm -trees whose fruits 
[Page 150, Line 79] are delicious?  
[Page 150, Line 80] 139 
[Page 151, Line 1] 26.  THE POETS   (ash-Shu’ara’)  
[Page 151, Line 2] 149. And you skillfully carve houses in the 
[Page 151, Line 3] mountains?  
[Page 151, Line 4] 150. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 151, Line 5] 151. And do not obey the command of the ex-
[Page 151, Line 6] travagant.  
[Page 151, Line 7] 152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not 
[Page 151, Line 8] reform.”  
[Page 151, Line 9] 153. They said, “You are surely one of the be-
[Page 151, Line 10] witched.  
[Page 151, Line 11] 154. You are nothing but a man like us. So 
[Page 151, Line 12] bring us a sign, if you are truthful.  
[Page 151, Line 13] 155. He said, “This is a she -camel; she has her 
[Page 151, Line 14] turn of d rinking, and you have your turn of 
[Page 151, Line 15] drinking —on a specified day.  
[Page 151, Line 16] 156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the 
[Page 151, Line 17] punishment of a great day seizes you.”  
[Page 151, Line 18] 157. But they slaughtered her, and became full 
[Page 151, Line 19] of remorse.  
[Page 151, Line 20] 158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely 
[Page 151, Line 21] in this is a sign, but most of them are not be-
[Page 151, Line 22] lievers.  
[Page 151, Line 23] 159. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 151, Line 24] 160. The people of Lot disbelieved the messen-
[Page 151, Line 25] gers.  
[Page 151, Line 26] 161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do 
[Page 151, Line 27] you not fear?  
[Page 151, Line 28] 162. I am to you a faithful messenger.  
[Page 151, Line 29] 163. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 151, Line 30] 164. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
[Page 151, Line 31] ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 151, Line 32] 165. Do you approach the males of the world?  
[Page 151, Line 33] 166. And forsake the wives your Lord created 
[Page 151, Line 34] for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”  
[Page 151, Line 35] 167. They sa id, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you 
[Page 151, Line 36] will be expelled.”  
[Page 151, Line 37] 168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con-
[Page 151, Line 38] duct.”  
[Page 151, Line 39] 169. “My Lord, save me and my family from 
[Page 151, Line 40] what they do.”  
[Page 151, Line 41] 170. So We saved him and his family, alto-
[Page 151, Line 42] gether.  171. Except for an old woman among those 
[Page 151, Line 43] who tarried.  
[Page 151, Line 44] 172. Then We destroyed the others.  
[Page 151, Line 45] 173. And We rained down on them a rain. 
[Page 151, Line 46] Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.  
[Page 151, Line 47] 174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
[Page 151, Line 48] are not believers.  
[Page 151, Line 49] 175. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 151, Line 50] 176. The People of the Woods disbelieved the 
[Page 151, Line 51] messengers.  
[Page 151, Line 52] 177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not 
[Page 151, Line 53] fear?  
[Page 151, Line 54] 178. I am to you a trustworthy messenger.  
[Page 151, Line 55] 179. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 151, Line 56] 180. I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
[Page 151, Line 57] ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 151, Line 58] 181. Give full measure, and do not cheat.  
[Page 151, Line 59] 182. And weigh with accurate scales.  
[Page 151, Line 60] 183. And do not defraud people of their be-
[Page 151, Line 61] longings, and do not work corruption in the 
[Page 151, Line 62] land.  
[Page 151, Line 63] 184. And fear Him who created you and the 
[Page 151, Line 64] masses of old.”  
[Page 151, Line 65] 185. They said, “You are one of t hose be-
[Page 151, Line 66] witched.  
[Page 151, Line 67] 186. And you are nothing but a man like us; 
[Page 151, Line 68] and we think that you are a liar.  
[Page 151, Line 69] 187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky, 
[Page 151, Line 70] if you are truthful.”  
[Page 151, Line 71] 188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what 
[Page 151, Line 72] you do.”  
[Page 151, Line 73] 189. But they denied him. So the punishm ent 
[Page 151, Line 74] of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the 
[Page 151, Line 75] punishment of a great day.  
[Page 151, Line 76] 190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them 
[Page 151, Line 77] are not believers.  
[Page 151, Line 78] 191. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 151, Line 79] 192. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
[Page 151, Line 80] Worlds.  
[Page 151, Line 81] 193. The Hones t Spirit came down with it.  
[Page 151, Line 82] 140 
[Page 152, Line 1] 27.  THE ANT   (an-Naml)  
[Page 152, Line 2] 194. Upon your heart, that you may be one of 
[Page 152, Line 3] the warners.  
[Page 152, Line 4] 195. In a clear Arabic tongue.  
[Page 152, Line 5] 196. And it is in the scriptures of the ancients.  
[Page 152, Line 6] 197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars 
[Page 152, Line 7] of the Children of Israel recognized it?  
[Page 152, Line 8] 198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign-
[Page 152, Line 9] ers. 
[Page 152, Line 10] 199. And he had recited it to them, they still 
[Page 152, Line 11] would not have believed in it.  
[Page 152, Line 12] 200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts 
[Page 152, Line 13] of the guilty.  
[Page 152, Line 14] 201. They will not believe in it until they wit-
[Page 152, Line 15] ness the painful punishment.  
[Page 152, Line 16] 202. It will come to them suddenly, while they 
[Page 152, Line 17] are unaware.  
[Page 152, Line 18] 203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res-
[Page 152, Line 19] pite?”  
[Page 152, Line 20] 204. Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?  
[Page 152, Line 21] 205. Have you considered: if We let them enjoy 
[Page 152, Line 22] themselves for some years.  
[Page 152, Line 23] 206. Then the re comes to them what they were 
[Page 152, Line 24] promised.  
[Page 152, Line 25] 207. Of what avail to them will be their past en-
[Page 152, Line 26] joyments?  
[Page 152, Line 27] 208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had 
[Page 152, Line 28] warners.  
[Page 152, Line 29] 209. As a reminder —We are never unjust.  
[Page 152, Line 30] 210. It was not the devils that revealed it.  
[Page 152, Line 31] 211. It is not i n their interests, nor in their 
[Page 152, Line 32] power.  
[Page 152, Line 33] 212. They are barred from hearing.  
[Page 152, Line 34] 213. So do not pray to another god with Allah, 
[Page 152, Line 35] else you will be of those tormented.  
[Page 152, Line 36] 214. And warn your close relatives.  
[Page 152, Line 37] 215. And lower your wing to those of the be-
[Page 152, Line 38] lievers who follow you.  
[Page 152, Line 39] 216. And if they disobey you, say, “I am inno-
[Page 152, Line 40] cent of what you do.”  
[Page 152, Line 41] 217. And put your trust in the Almighty, the 
[Page 152, Line 42] Merciful.  218. He Who sees you when you rise.  
[Page 152, Line 43] 219. And your devotions amidst the wor-
[Page 152, Line 44] shipers.  
[Page 152, Line 45] 220. He is indeed the Hearer, the Aware.  
[Page 152, Line 46] 221. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils 
[Page 152, Line 47] descend?  
[Page 152, Line 48] 222. They descend upon every sinful liar.  
[Page 152, Line 49] 223. They give ear, and most of them are liars.  
[Page 152, Line 50] 224. And as for the poets —the deviators follow 
[Page 152, Line 51] them.  
[Page 152, Line 52] 225. Do you not see how they ramble in every 
[Page 152, Line 53] style?  
[Page 152, Line 54] 226. And how  they say what they do not do?  
[Page 152, Line 55] 227. Except for those who believe, and do good 
[Page 152, Line 56] deeds, and remember Allah frequently, and 
[Page 152, Line 57] defend themselves after they are wronged. As for those who do wrong, they will know by 
[Page 152, Line 58] what overturning they will be overturned.  

[Page 152, Line 60] 27. THE ANT  
[Page 152, Line 61] (an-Naml ) 
[Page 152, Line 62] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 152, Line 63] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 152, Line 64] 1. Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran —
[Page 152, Line 65] a book that makes things clear.  
[Page 152, Line 66] 2. Guidance and good news for the believers.  
[Page 152, Line 67] 3. Those who observe the prayers, and give 
[Page 152, Line 68] charity regularly, and are certain of the Here-
[Page 152, Line 69] after.  
[Page 152, Line 70] 4. As for those who do not believe in the Here-
[Page 152, Line 71] after: We made their deeds appear good to 
[Page 152, Line 72] them, so they wander aimlessly.  
[Page 152, Line 73] 5. It is they who will receive the grievous pun-
[Page 152, Line 74] ishment —and in the Hereafter they will be 
[Page 152, Line 75] the greatest lose rs. 
[Page 152, Line 76] 6. You are receiving the Quran from an All -
[Page 152, Line 77] Wise, All -Knowing.  
[Page 152, Line 78] 7. When Moses said to his family, “I have 
[Page 152, Line 79] glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news 
[Page 152, Line 80] from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you may warm yourselves.”  
[Page 152, Line 81] 141 
[Page 153, Line 1] 27.  THE ANT   (an-Naml)  
[Page 153, Line 2] 8. Then, when he reached it, he was ca lled: 
[Page 153, Line 3] “Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He 
[Page 153, Line 4] who is around it, and glorified be Allah, Lord 
[Page 153, Line 5] of the Worlds.  
[Page 153, Line 6] 9. O Moses, it is I, Allah, the Almighty, the 
[Page 153, Line 7] Wise.  
[Page 153, Line 8] 10. Throw down your staff.” But when he saw 
[Page 153, Line 9] it quivering, as though it were a demon, he 
[Page 153, Line 10] turned around not looking back. “O Moses, 
[Page 153, Line 11] do not fear; the messengers do not fear in My 
[Page 153, Line 12] presence.  
[Page 153, Line 13] 11. But whoever has done wrong, and then 
[Page 153, Line 14] substituted goodness in place of evil. I am 
[Page 153, Line 15] Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 153, Line 16] 12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it 
[Page 153, Line 17] will c ome out white, without blemish—
[Page 153, Line 18] among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his peo-ple, for they are immoral people.”  
[Page 153, Line 19] 13. Yet when Our enlightening signs came to 
[Page 153, Line 20] them, they said, “This is obvious witchcraft.”  
[Page 153, Line 21] 14. And they rejected them, although their 
[Page 153, Line 22] souls were cer tain of them, out of wickedness 
[Page 153, Line 23] and pride. So see how the outcome was for 
[Page 153, Line 24] the mischief -makers.  
[Page 153, Line 25] 15. And We gave David and Solomon 
[Page 153, Line 26] knowledge. They said, “Praise Allah, who has 
[Page 153, Line 27] favored us over many of His believing serv-
[Page 153, Line 28] ants.”  
[Page 153, Line 29] 16. And Solomon succeeded David. He said, 
[Page 153, Line 30] “O people, we were taught the language of 
[Page 153, Line 31] birds, and we were given from everything. 
[Page 153, Line 32] This is indeed a real blessing.”  
[Page 153, Line 33] 17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized 
[Page 153, Line 34] his troops of sprites, and men, and birds —all 
[Page 153, Line 35] held in strict order.  
[Page 153, Line 36] 18. Until, when t hey came upon the Valley of 
[Page 153, Line 37] Ants, an ant said, “O ants! Go into your nests, lest Solomon and his troops crush you with-
[Page 153, Line 38] out noticing.”  
[Page 153, Line 39] 19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and 
[Page 153, Line 40] said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for 
[Page 153, Line 41] the blessings you have bestowed up on me 
[Page 153, Line 42] and upon my parents, and to do good works 
[Page 153, Line 43] that please You. And admit me, by Your grace, into the company of Your virtuous 
[Page 153, Line 44] servants.”  
[Page 153, Line 45] 20. Then he inspected the birds, and said, 
[Page 153, Line 46] “Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he 
[Page 153, Line 47] among the absentees?  
[Page 153, Line 48] 21. I will pun ish him most severely, or slay 
[Page 153, Line 49] him, unless he gives me a valid excuse.”  
[Page 153, Line 50] 22. But he did not stay for long. He said, “I 
[Page 153, Line 51] have learnt something you did not know. I 
[Page 153, Line 52] have come to you from Sheba, with reliable 
[Page 153, Line 53] information.  
[Page 153, Line 54] 23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she 
[Page 153, Line 55] was given of everything, and she has a mag-nificent throne.  
[Page 153, Line 56] 24. I found her and her people worshiping the 
[Page 153, Line 57] sun, instead of Allah. Satan made their con-
[Page 153, Line 58] duct appear good to them, and diverted them 
[Page 153, Line 59] from the path, so they are not guided.  
[Page 153, Line 60] 25. If only they would worship Allah, who 
[Page 153, Line 61] brings to light the mysteries of the heavens 
[Page 153, Line 62] and the earth, and knows what you conceal 
[Page 153, Line 63] and what you reveal.  
[Page 153, Line 64] 26.  Allah— There is no god but He, the Lord 
[Page 153, Line 65] of the Sublime Throne.”  
[Page 153, Line 66] 27. He said, “We will see, whether you have 
[Page 153, Line 67] spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar.  
[Page 153, Line 68] 28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to 
[Page 153, Line 69] them; then withdraw from them, and see how they respond.”  
[Page 153, Line 70] 29. She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter 
[Page 153, Line 71] was delivered to me.  
[Page 153, Line 72] 30. It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Na me 
[Page 153, Line 73] of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.  
[Page 153, Line 74] 31. Do not defy me, and come to me submis-
[Page 153, Line 75] sively.’”  
[Page 153, Line 76] 32. She said, “O counselors, advise me in this 
[Page 153, Line 77] matter of mine. I never make a decision un-less you are present.”  
[Page 153, Line 78] 33. They said, “We are a people of might and 
[Page 153, Line 79] great c ourage, but the decision is yours, so 
[Page 153, Line 80] consider what you wish to command.”  
[Page 153, Line 81] 34. She said, “When kings enter a city, they 
[Page 153, Line 82] devastate it, and subjugate its dignified peo-
[Page 153, Line 83] ple. Thus they always do.  
[Page 153, Line 84] 142 
[Page 154, Line 1] 27.  THE ANT   (an-Naml)  
[Page 154, Line 2] 35. I am sending them a gift, and will see what 
[Page 154, Line 3] the envoys bring b ack.”  
[Page 154, Line 4] 36. When he came to Solomon, he said, “Are 
[Page 154, Line 5] you supplying me with money? What Allah 
[Page 154, Line 6] has given me is better than what He has given 
[Page 154, Line 7] you. It is you who delight in your gift.  
[Page 154, Line 8] 37. Go back to them. We will come upon them 
[Page 154, Line 9] with troops they cannot resist; and we will ex-
[Page 154, Line 10] pel them from there, disgraced and humili-
[Page 154, Line 11] ated.”  
[Page 154, Line 12] 38. He said, “O notables, which one of you will 
[Page 154, Line 13] bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?”  
[Page 154, Line 14] 39. An imp of the sprites said, “I will bring it to 
[Page 154, Line 15] you before you rise from your seat. I a m 
[Page 154, Line 16] strong and reliable enough to do it.”  
[Page 154, Line 17] 40. He who had knowledge from the Book 
[Page 154, Line 18] said, “I will bring it to you before your glance 
[Page 154, Line 19] returns to you.” And when he saw it settled 
[Page 154, Line 20] before him, he said, “This is from the grace of 
[Page 154, Line 21] my Lord, to test me, whether I am gr ateful or 
[Page 154, Line 22] ungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude 
[Page 154, Line 23] is to his own credit; but he who is ungrate-
[Page 154, Line 24] ful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”  
[Page 154, Line 25] 41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and 
[Page 154, Line 26] we shall see whether she will be guided, or re-
[Page 154, Line 27] mains one of the misgu ided.”  
[Page 154, Line 28] 42. When she arrived, it was said, “Is your 
[Page 154, Line 29] throne like this?” She said, “As if this is it.” 
[Page 154, Line 30] “We were given knowledge before her, and 
[Page 154, Line 31] we were submissive.”  
[Page 154, Line 32] 43. But she was prevented by what she wor-
[Page 154, Line 33] shiped besides Allah; she belonged to a disbe-
[Page 154, Line 34] lieving people.  
[Page 154, Line 35] 44. It was said to her, “Go inside the palace.” 
[Page 154, Line 36] And when she saw it, she thought it was a 
[Page 154, Line 37] deep pond, and she bared her legs. He said, “It is a palace paved with glass.” She said, “My 
[Page 154, Line 38] Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have 
[Page 154, Line 39] submitted with Solomon, to Allah, Lord of 
[Page 154, Line 40] the Worlds.”  
[Page 154, Line 41] 45. And We sent to Thamood their brother 
[Page 154, Line 42] Saleh: “Worship Allah.” But they became two disputing factions.  46. He said, “O my people, why are you quick 
[Page 154, Line 43] to do evil rather than good? If only you would 
[Page 154, Line 44] seek Allah’s forgivenes s, so that you may be 
[Page 154, Line 45] shown mercy.”  
[Page 154, Line 46] 47. They said, “We consider you an ill omen, 
[Page 154, Line 47] and those with you.” He said, “Your omen is with Allah. In fact, you are a people being 
[Page 154, Line 48] tested.”  
[Page 154, Line 49] 48. In the city was a gang of nine who made 
[Page 154, Line 50] mischief in the land and did no go od. 
[Page 154, Line 51] 49. They said, “Swear by Allah to one another 
[Page 154, Line 52] that we will attack him and his family by 
[Page 154, Line 53] night, and then tell his guardian, 'We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are 
[Page 154, Line 54] being truthful.'“  
[Page 154, Line 55] 50. They planned a plan, and We planned a 
[Page 154, Line 56] plan, but th ey did not notice.  
[Page 154, Line 57] 51. So note the outcome of their planning; We 
[Page 154, Line 58] destroyed them and their people, altogether.  
[Page 154, Line 59] 52. Here are their homes, in ruins, on account 
[Page 154, Line 60] of their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for 
[Page 154, Line 61] people who know.  
[Page 154, Line 62] 53. And We saved those who believed and 
[Page 154, Line 63] were pious.  
[Page 154, Line 64] 54. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do 
[Page 154, Line 65] you commit lewdness with open eyes?  
[Page 154, Line 66] 55. Do you lust after men instead of women? 
[Page 154, Line 67] You are truly ignorant people.”  
[Page 154, Line 68] 56. But the only response of his people was to 
[Page 154, Line 69] say, “Expel the family of L ot from your town. 
[Page 154, Line 70] They are purist people.”  
[Page 154, Line 71] 57. So We saved him and his family, except for 
[Page 154, Line 72] his wife, whom We destined to be among the 
[Page 154, Line 73] laggards.  
[Page 154, Line 74] 58. And We rained upon them a rain. Misera-
[Page 154, Line 75] ble was the rain of those forewarned.  
[Page 154, Line 76] 59. Say, “Praise Allah, and peac e be upon His 
[Page 154, Line 77] servants whom He has selected. Is Allah bet-ter, or what they associate?”  
[Page 154, Line 78] 60. Or, who created the heavens and the earth, 
[Page 154, Line 79] and rains down water from the sky for you? 
[Page 154, Line 80] With it We produce gardens full of beauty, whose trees you could not have produ ced. Is 
[Page 154, Line 81] 143 
[Page 155, Line 1] 27.  THE ANT   (an-Nam l) 
[Page 155, Line 2] there another god with Allah? But they are a 
[Page 155, Line 3] people who equate.  
[Page 155, Line 4] 61. Or, who made the earth habitable, and 
[Page 155, Line 5] made rivers flow through it, and set moun-
[Page 155, Line 6] tains on it, and placed a partition between the 
[Page 155, Line 7] two seas? Is there another god with Allah? But most of them do not know.  
[Page 155, Line 8] 62. Or, who answers the one in need when he 
[Page 155, Line 9] prays to Him, and relieves adversity, and 
[Page 155, Line 10] makes you successors on earth? Is there an-
[Page 155, Line 11] other god with Allah? How hardly you pay at-
[Page 155, Line 12] tention.  
[Page 155, Line 13] 63. Or, who guides you through the darkness 
[Page 155, Line 14] of land and sea, and who sends the winds as 
[Page 155, Line 15] heralds of His mercy? Is there another god 
[Page 155, Line 16] with Allah? Most exalted is Allah, above what 
[Page 155, Line 17] they associate.  
[Page 155, Line 18] 64. Or, who originates the creation and then 
[Page 155, Line 19] repeats it, and who gives you livelihood from 
[Page 155, Line 20] the sky and the earth? Is th ere another god 
[Page 155, Line 21] with Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if 
[Page 155, Line 22] you are truthful.”  
[Page 155, Line 23] 65. Say, “No one in the heavens or on earth 
[Page 155, Line 24] knows the future except Allah; and they do 
[Page 155, Line 25] not perceive when they will be resurrected.”  
[Page 155, Line 26] 66. In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter  is 
[Page 155, Line 27] confused. In fact, they are in doubt about it. In fact, they are blind to it.  
[Page 155, Line 28] 67. Those who disbelieve say, “When we have 
[Page 155, Line 29] become dust, and our ancestors, shall we be 
[Page 155, Line 30] brought out?  
[Page 155, Line 31] 68. We were promised that before, we and our 
[Page 155, Line 32] ancestors —these are nothing but legends of 
[Page 155, Line 33] the ancients.”  
[Page 155, Line 34] 69. Say, travel through the earth, and observe 
[Page 155, Line 35] the fate of the guilty.”  
[Page 155, Line 36] 70. But do not grieve over them, and do not be 
[Page 155, Line 37] troubled by what they plot.  
[Page 155, Line 38] 71. And they say, “When is this promise, if you 
[Page 155, Line 39] are truthful?”  
[Page 155, Line 40] 72. Say, “Perhaps some of what you are impa-
[Page 155, Line 41] tient for has drawn near.”  
[Page 155, Line 42] 73. Your Lord is gracious towards humanity, 
[Page 155, Line 43] but most of them are not thankful.  74. And your Lord knows what their hearts 
[Page 155, Line 44] conceal, and what they reveal.  
[Page 155, Line 45] 75. There is no mystery in the heaven and t he 
[Page 155, Line 46] earth, but it is in a Clear Book.  
[Page 155, Line 47] 76. This Quran relates to the Children of Israel 
[Page 155, Line 48] most of what they differ about.  
[Page 155, Line 49] 77. And it is guidance and mercy for the be-
[Page 155, Line 50] lievers.  
[Page 155, Line 51] 78. Your Lord will judge between them by His 
[Page 155, Line 52] wisdom. He is the Almighty, the All -Know-
[Page 155, Line 53] ing. 
[Page 155, Line 54] 79. So rely on Allah. You are upon the clear 
[Page 155, Line 55] truth.  
[Page 155, Line 56] 80. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can 
[Page 155, Line 57] you make the deaf hear the call if they turn their backs and flee.  
[Page 155, Line 58] 81. Nor can you guide the blind out of their 
[Page 155, Line 59] straying. You can make no one listen, except 
[Page 155, Line 60] those who believe in Our verses; for they are 
[Page 155, Line 61] Muslims.  
[Page 155, Line 62] 82. And when the Word has fallen on them, 
[Page 155, Line 63] We will bring out for them from the earth a 
[Page 155, Line 64] creature which will say to them that the peo-
[Page 155, Line 65] ple are uncertain of Our revelations.  
[Page 155, Line 66] 83. On the Day when We gather fro m every 
[Page 155, Line 67] community a group of those who rejected 
[Page 155, Line 68] Our revelations; and they will be restrained.  
[Page 155, Line 69] 84. Until, when they arrive, He will say, “Did 
[Page 155, Line 70] you reject My revelations without compre-
[Page 155, Line 71] hending them? Or what is it you were doing?”  
[Page 155, Line 72] 85. The Word will come down up on them for 
[Page 155, Line 73] their wrongdoing, and they will not speak.  
[Page 155, Line 74] 86. Do they not see that We made the night for 
[Page 155, Line 75] them to rest therein, and the day for visibil-
[Page 155, Line 76] ity? Surely in that are signs for people who 
[Page 155, Line 77] believe.  
[Page 155, Line 78] 87. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown, 
[Page 155, Line 79] everyone in t he heavens and the earth will be 
[Page 155, Line 80] horrified, except whomever Allah wills; and everyone will come before Him in humility.  
[Page 155, Line 81] 88. And you see the mountains, and imagine 
[Page 155, Line 82] them fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the 
[Page 155, Line 83] 144 
[Page 156, Line 1] 28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  
[Page 156, Line 2] clouds —the making of Allah, who has per-
[Page 156, Line 3] fecte d everything. He is fully Informed of 
[Page 156, Line 4] what you do.  
[Page 156, Line 5] 89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
[Page 156, Line 6] than it —and they will be safe from the hor-
[Page 156, Line 7] rors of that Day.  
[Page 156, Line 8] 90. But whoever brings evil —their faces will be 
[Page 156, Line 9] tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded 
[Page 156, Line 10] excep t for what you used to do?  
[Page 156, Line 11] 91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of 
[Page 156, Line 12] this town, who has sanctified it, and to 
[Page 156, Line 13] Whom everything belongs; and I was com-
[Page 156, Line 14] manded to be of those who submit.  
[Page 156, Line 15] 92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is 
[Page 156, Line 16] guided —is guided to his own adv antage. And 
[Page 156, Line 17] whoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of the warners.”  
[Page 156, Line 18] 93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will 
[Page 156, Line 19] show you His signs, and you will recognize 
[Page 156, Line 20] them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you 
[Page 156, Line 21] do.” 

[Page 156, Line 23] 28. HISTORY  
[Page 156, Line 24] (al-Qasas ) 
[Page 156, Line 25] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 156, Line 26] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 156, Line 27] 1. Ta, Seen, Meem.  
[Page 156, Line 28] 2. These are the Verses of the Clear Book.  
[Page 156, Line 29] 3. We narrate to you from the history of Mo-
[Page 156, Line 30] ses and Pharaoh —in truth— for people who 
[Page 156, Line 31] believe.  
[Page 156, Line 32] 4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di-
[Page 156, Line 33] vided its people into faction s. He persecuted 
[Page 156, Line 34] a group of them, slaughtering their sons, 
[Page 156, Line 35] while sparing their daughters. He was truly a 
[Page 156, Line 36] corrupter.  
[Page 156, Line 37] 5. But We desired to favor those who were op-
[Page 156, Line 38] pressed in the land, and to make them lead-
[Page 156, Line 39] ers, and to make them the inheritors.  
[Page 156, Line 40] 6. And to establ ish them in the land; and to 
[Page 156, Line 41] show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the 
[Page 156, Line 42] very thing they feared.  7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse 
[Page 156, Line 43] him; then, when you fear for him, cast him 
[Page 156, Line 44] into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We 
[Page 156, Line 45] will return him to you, and make him one of 
[Page 156, Line 46] the messengers.”  
[Page 156, Line 47] 8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be 
[Page 156, Line 48] an opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.  
[Page 156, Line 49] 9. Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me 
[Page 156, Line 50] and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will 
[Page 156, Line 51] be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a 
[Page 156, Line 52] son.” But they did not foresee.  
[Page 156, Line 53] 10. The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. 
[Page 156, Line 54] She was about to disclose him, had We not 
[Page 156, Line 55] steadied her heart, that she may remain a be-
[Page 156, Line 56] liever.  
[Page 156, Line 57] 11. She said to his sister, “Trail hi m.” So she 
[Page 156, Line 58] watched him from afar, and they were una-
[Page 156, Line 59] ware.  
[Page 156, Line 60] 12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So 
[Page 156, Line 61] she said, “Shall I tell you about a family that can raise him for you, and will look after 
[Page 156, Line 62] him?”  
[Page 156, Line 63] 13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that 
[Page 156, Line 64] she may be comforted, and not grieve, and 
[Page 156, Line 65] know that Allah’s promise is true. But most of them do not know.  
[Page 156, Line 66] 14. And when he reached his maturity, and be-
[Page 156, Line 67] came established, We gave him wisdom and 
[Page 156, Line 68] knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.  
[Page 156, Line 69] 15. Once he entered the city, un noticed by its 
[Page 156, Line 70] people. He found in it two men fighting —one 
[Page 156, Line 71] of his own sect, and one from his enemies. 
[Page 156, Line 72] The one of his sect solicited his assistance 
[Page 156, Line 73] against the one from his enemies; so Moses 
[Page 156, Line 74] punched him, and put an end to him. He said, 
[Page 156, Line 75] “This is of Satan's d oing; he is an enemy that 
[Page 156, Line 76] openly misleads.”  
[Page 156, Line 77] 16. He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, 
[Page 156, Line 78] so forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the 
[Page 156, Line 79] Forgiver, the Merciful.  
[Page 156, Line 80] 17. He said, “My Lord, in as much as you have 
[Page 156, Line 81] favored me, I will never be a supporter of the 
[Page 156, Line 82] crim inals.”  
[Page 156, Line 83] 145 
[Page 157, Line 1] 28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  
[Page 157, Line 2] 18. The next morning, he went about in the 
[Page 157, Line 3] city, fearful and vigilant, when the man who 
[Page 157, Line 4] had sought his assistance the day before was 
[Page 157, Line 5] shouting out to him. Moses said to him, “You 
[Page 157, Line 6] are clearly a troublemaker.”  
[Page 157, Line 7] 19. As he was about to strike the one who was 
[Page 157, Line 8] their enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you in-
[Page 157, Line 9] tend to kill me, as you killed someone yester-
[Page 157, Line 10] day? You only want to be a bully in the land, and do not want to be a peacemaker.”  
[Page 157, Line 11] 20. And a man came from the farthest part of 
[Page 157, Line 12] the city running. He said, “O Moses, the au-
[Page 157, Line 13] thorities are considering killing you, so leave; I am giving you good advice.”  
[Page 157, Line 14] 21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My 
[Page 157, Line 15] Lord, deliver me from the wrongdoing peo-
[Page 157, Line 16] ple.”  
[Page 157, Line 17] 22. As he headed towards Median, he said, 
[Page 157, Line 18] “Perhaps my Lord will guide me t o the right 
[Page 157, Line 19] way.”  
[Page 157, Line 20] 23. And when he arrived at the waters of Me-
[Page 157, Line 21] dian, he found there a crowd of people draw-
[Page 157, Line 22] ing water, and he noticed two women waiting 
[Page 157, Line 23] on the side. He said, “What is the matter with 
[Page 157, Line 24] you?” They said, “We cannot draw water un-
[Page 157, Line 25] til the shepherds de part, and our father is a 
[Page 157, Line 26] very old man.”  
[Page 157, Line 27] 24. So he drew water for them, and then with-
[Page 157, Line 28] drew to the shade, and said, “My Lord, I am 
[Page 157, Line 29] in dire need of whatever good you might send 
[Page 157, Line 30] down to me.”  
[Page 157, Line 31] 25. Then, one of the two women approached 
[Page 157, Line 32] him, walking bashfully. She  said, “My father 
[Page 157, Line 33] is calling you, to reward you for drawing wa-
[Page 157, Line 34] ter for us.” And when he came to him, and 
[Page 157, Line 35] told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you 
[Page 157, Line 36] have escaped from the wrongdoing people.”  
[Page 157, Line 37] 26. One of the two women said, “Father, hire 
[Page 157, Line 38] him; the best empl oyee for you is the strong 
[Page 157, Line 39] and trustworthy.”  
[Page 157, Line 40] 27. He said, “I want to marry you to one of 
[Page 157, Line 41] these two daughters of mine, provided you work for me for eight years. But if you com-plete ten, that is up to you. I do not intend to 
[Page 157, Line 42] impose any hardship on you. You w ill find 
[Page 157, Line 43] me, Allah willing, one of the righteous.”  28. He said, “Let this be an agreement between 
[Page 157, Line 44] you and me. Whichever of the two terms I 
[Page 157, Line 45] fulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me; 
[Page 157, Line 46] and Allah is witness over what we say.”  
[Page 157, Line 47] 29. When Moses had completed the term, and 
[Page 157, Line 48] departed with his family, he noticed a fire by 
[Page 157, Line 49] the side of the Mount. He said to his family, 
[Page 157, Line 50] “Stay here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I 
[Page 157, Line 51] can bring you some information from there, 
[Page 157, Line 52] or an ember from the fire, that you may warm 
[Page 157, Line 53] yourselves.”  
[Page 157, Line 54] 30. When he reached it, he was called from the 
[Page 157, Line 55] right side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot, 
[Page 157, Line 56] from the bush: “O Moses, it is I, Allah, the 
[Page 157, Line 57] Lord of the Worlds.  
[Page 157, Line 58] 31. Throw down your staff.” And when he saw 
[Page 157, Line 59] it wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned 
[Page 157, Line 60] his bac k to flee, and did not look back. “O 
[Page 157, Line 61] Moses, come forward, and do not fear, you 
[Page 157, Line 62] are perfectly safe.  
[Page 157, Line 63] 32. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it 
[Page 157, Line 64] will come out white, without blemish. And 
[Page 157, Line 65] press your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from y our Lord, to 
[Page 157, Line 66] Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly 
[Page 157, Line 67] sinful people.”  
[Page 157, Line 68] 33. He said, “My Lord, I have killed one of 
[Page 157, Line 69] them, and I fear they will kill me.  
[Page 157, Line 70] 34. And my brother Aaron, he is more elo-
[Page 157, Line 71] quent than me, so send him with me, to help 
[Page 157, Line 72] me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they 
[Page 157, Line 73] will reject me.”  
[Page 157, Line 74] 35. He said, “We will strengthen your arm with 
[Page 157, Line 75] your brother, and We will give you authority, 
[Page 157, Line 76] so they will not touch you. By virtue of Our signs, you and those who follow you will be 
[Page 157, Line 77] the triumphant.”  
[Page 157, Line 78] 36. But when Moses came to them with Our 
[Page 157, Line 79] signs, clear and manifest, they said, “This is nothing but fabricated magic, and We never 
[Page 157, Line 80] heard of this from our ancestors of old.”  
[Page 157, Line 81] 37. Moses said, “My Lord is well aware of him 
[Page 157, Line 82] who brings guidance from Him, and him 
[Page 157, Line 83] who will hav e the sequel of the abode. The 
[Page 157, Line 84] wrongdoers will not succeed.”  
[Page 157, Line 85] 146 
[Page 158, Line 1] 28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  
[Page 158, Line 2] 38. Pharaoh said, “O nobles, I know of no god 
[Page 158, Line 3] for you other than me. So fire -up the bricks 
[Page 158, Line 4] for me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that 
[Page 158, Line 5] I may ascend to the God of Moses, though I 
[Page 158, Line 6] think he is a liar.”  
[Page 158, Line 7] 39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the 
[Page 158, Line 8] land, with no justification. They thought they would not be returned to Us.  
[Page 158, Line 9] 40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We 
[Page 158, Line 10] threw them into the sea. Observe, therefore, 
[Page 158, Line 11] what was the end of the oppressors.  
[Page 158, Line 12] 41. And We made them leaders calling to the 
[Page 158, Line 13] Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not 
[Page 158, Line 14] be saved.  
[Page 158, Line 15] 42. And We pursued them in this world with a 
[Page 158, Line 16] curse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be among the despised.  
[Page 158, Line 17] 43. We gave Moses the Scripture after We had 
[Page 158, Line 18] annihi lated the previous generations; as an il-
[Page 158, Line 19] lumination for mankind, and guidance, and mercy, so that they may remember.  
[Page 158, Line 20] 44. You were not on the Western Side when 
[Page 158, Line 21] We decreed the command to Moses, nor 
[Page 158, Line 22] were you among the witnesses.  
[Page 158, Line 23] 45. But We established many gen erations, and 
[Page 158, Line 24] time took its toll on them. Nor were you among the people of Median, reciting Our 
[Page 158, Line 25] revelations to them. But We kept sending 
[Page 158, Line 26] messengers.  
[Page 158, Line 27] 46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount 
[Page 158, Line 28] when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy 
[Page 158, Line 29] from your Lord, that y ou may warn people 
[Page 158, Line 30] who received no warner before you, so that 
[Page 158, Line 31] they may take heed.  
[Page 158, Line 32] 47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a re-
[Page 158, Line 33] sult of what their hands have perpetrated, 
[Page 158, Line 34] they would say, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have follo wed 
[Page 158, Line 35] Your revelations, and been among the believ-
[Page 158, Line 36] ers.”  
[Page 158, Line 37] 48. But when the truth came to them from Us, 
[Page 158, Line 38] they said, “If only he was given the like of 
[Page 158, Line 39] what was given to Moses.” Did they not dis-
[Page 158, Line 40] believe in what was given to Moses in the past? They said, “Two works o f magic back-
[Page 158, Line 41] ing one another.” And they said, “We are dis-believing in both.”  
[Page 158, Line 42] 49. Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah, 
[Page 158, Line 43] more conductive to guidance than both, and 
[Page 158, Line 44] I will follow it, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 158, Line 45] 50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that 
[Page 158, Line 46] they follow their fancies. And who is more 
[Page 158, Line 47] lost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide 
[Page 158, Line 48] the unjust people.  
[Page 158, Line 49] 51. We have delivered the Word to them, that 
[Page 158, Line 50] they may remember.  
[Page 158, Line 51] 52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture be-
[Page 158, Line 52] fore it believe in it.  
[Page 158, Line 53] 53. When it is recited to them, they say, “We 
[Page 158, Line 54] have believed in it; it is the truth from our 
[Page 158, Line 55] Lord; we were Muslims prior to it.”  
[Page 158, Line 56] 54. These will be given their reward twice, be-
[Page 158, Line 57] cause they persevered; and they counter evil 
[Page 158, Line 58] with good; and from Our provisions to them, 
[Page 158, Line 59] they give.  
[Page 158, Line 60] 55. And when they hear vain talk, they avoid 
[Page 158, Line 61] it, and say, “We have our deeds, and you have 
[Page 158, Line 62] your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not de-
[Page 158, Line 63] sire the ignorant.”  
[Page 158, Line 64] 56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Al-
[Page 158, Line 65] lah guides whom He wills, and He knows best 
[Page 158, Line 66] those who are guided.  
[Page 158, Line 67] 57. And they say, “If we follow the guidance 
[Page 158, Line 68] with you, we will be snatched from our land.” Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctu-
[Page 158, Line 69] ary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits, 
[Page 158, Line 70] as provision from Ourselves? But most of 
[Page 158, Line 71] them do not know.  
[Page 158, Line 72] 58. And how many a city did We destroy for 
[Page 158, Line 73] turning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here 
[Page 158, Line 74] are their homes, uninhabited after them, ex-cept for a few. And We became the Inheri-
[Page 158, Line 75] tors.  
[Page 158, Line 76] 59. Your Lord never destroys cities without 
[Page 158, Line 77] first sending a messenger in their midst, re-
[Page 158, Line 78] citing to them Our revelations. And We 
[Page 158, Line 79] never destroy the cities, unless their people 
[Page 158, Line 80] are wrongdoers.  
[Page 158, Line 81] 147 
[Page 159, Line 1] 28.  HISTORY   (al-Qasas)  
[Page 159, Line 2] 60. Whatever thing you are given is but the 
[Page 159, Line 3] material of this world, and its glitter. But 
[Page 159, Line 4] what is with Allah is better, and longer last-
[Page 159, Line 5] ing. Do you not comprehend?  
[Page 159, Line 6] 61. Can someone to whom We have made a 
[Page 159, Line 7] fine promise —which he will attain —be equal 
[Page 159, Line 8] to someone to whom We have given enjoy-
[Page 159, Line 9] ments in this world, but who will be, on Res-
[Page 159, Line 10] urrection Day, among the arraigned?  
[Page 159, Line 11] 62. On t he Day when He will call to them, and 
[Page 159, Line 12] say, “Where are My associates whom you 
[Page 159, Line 13] used to claim?”  
[Page 159, Line 14] 63. Those against whom the sentence is justi-
[Page 159, Line 15] fied will say, “Our Lord, these are they whom 
[Page 159, Line 16] we misled. We misled them, as we were mis-
[Page 159, Line 17] led. We beg Your forgiveness; it  was not us 
[Page 159, Line 18] they used to worship.”  
[Page 159, Line 19] 64. And it will be said, “Call on your partners.” 
[Page 159, Line 20] And they will call on them, but they will not respond to them. And they will see the suffer-
[Page 159, Line 21] ing. If only they were guided.  
[Page 159, Line 22] 65. On the Day when He will call to them, and 
[Page 159, Line 23] say, “What did you answer the Messengers?”  
[Page 159, Line 24] 66. They will be blinded by the facts on that 
[Page 159, Line 25] Day, and they will not question each other.  
[Page 159, Line 26] 67. But he who repents, and believes, and does 
[Page 159, Line 27] righteous deeds, may well be among the win-
[Page 159, Line 28] ners.  
[Page 159, Line 29] 68. Your Lord creates whatev er He wills, and 
[Page 159, Line 30] He chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be to Allah, and exalted be He above the associ-
[Page 159, Line 31] ations they make.  
[Page 159, Line 32] 69. And your Lord knows what their hearts 
[Page 159, Line 33] conceal, and what they reveal.  
[Page 159, Line 34] 70. And He is Allah. There is no god but He. 
[Page 159, Line 35] To Him belon gs all praise in this life, and in 
[Page 159, Line 36] the next. And His is the decision, and to Him 
[Page 159, Line 37] you will be returned.  
[Page 159, Line 38] 71. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah 
[Page 159, Line 39] made the night perpetual over you until the 
[Page 159, Line 40] Day of Resurrection, which god other than 
[Page 159, Line 41] Allah will bring you illumination? Do you 
[Page 159, Line 42] not hear?”  
[Page 159, Line 43] 72. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah 
[Page 159, Line 44] made the day perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than 
[Page 159, Line 45] Allah will bring you night to rest in? Do you 
[Page 159, Line 46] not see?”  
[Page 159, Line 47] 73. It is out of His mercy that He made for you 
[Page 159, Line 48] the night and the day, that you may rest in it, 
[Page 159, Line 49] and seek some of His bounty; and that you 
[Page 159, Line 50] may give thanks.  
[Page 159, Line 51] 74. On the Day when He will call to them, and 
[Page 159, Line 52] say, “Where are My associates whom you 
[Page 159, Line 53] used to claim?”  
[Page 159, Line 54] 75. And We will draw out from every commu-
[Page 159, Line 55] nity a witness, and say, “Produce your evi-
[Page 159, Line 56] dence.” Then they will realize that the truth is 
[Page 159, Line 57] Allah’s, and those they used to invent have 
[Page 159, Line 58] forsaken them.  
[Page 159, Line 59] 76. Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, 
[Page 159, Line 60] but he oppressed them. We had given him treasures, the keys of which w ould weigh 
[Page 159, Line 61] down a group of strong men. His people said 
[Page 159, Line 62] to him, “Do not exult; Allah does not love the 
[Page 159, Line 63] exultant.  
[Page 159, Line 64] 77. But seek, with what Allah has given you, 
[Page 159, Line 65] the Home of the Hereafter, and do not ne-
[Page 159, Line 66] glect your share of this world. And be chari-table, as Allah  has been charitable to you. 
[Page 159, Line 67] And do not seek corruption in the land. Allah 
[Page 159, Line 68] does not like the seekers of corruption.”  
[Page 159, Line 69] 78. He said, “I was given all this on account of 
[Page 159, Line 70] knowledge I possess.” Did he not know that 
[Page 159, Line 71] Allah destroyed many generations before 
[Page 159, Line 72] him, wh o were stronger than he, and pos-
[Page 159, Line 73] sessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their sins.  
[Page 159, Line 74] 79. And he went out before his people in his 
[Page 159, Line 75] splendor. Those who desired the worldly life 
[Page 159, Line 76] said, “If only we possessed the likes of what 
[Page 159, Line 77] Quaroon was gi ven. He is indeed very fortu-
[Page 159, Line 78] nate.”  
[Page 159, Line 79] 80. But those who were given knowledge said, 
[Page 159, Line 80] “Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for 
[Page 159, Line 81] those who believe and do righteous deeds.” 
[Page 159, Line 82] Yet none attains it except the steadfast.  
[Page 159, Line 83] 81. So We caused the earth to cave in on him  
[Page 159, Line 84] and his mansion. He had no company to save 
[Page 159, Line 85] him from Allah, and he could not defend 
[Page 159, Line 86] himself.  
[Page 159, Line 87] 148 
[Page 160, Line 1] 29.  THE SPIDER   (al-’Ankabut)  
[Page 160, Line 2] 82. Those who had wished they were in his po-
[Page 160, Line 3] sition the day before were saying, “Indeed, it 
[Page 160, Line 4] is Allah who spreads the bounty to whomever 
[Page 160, Line 5] He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had 
[Page 160, Line 6] Allah not been gracious to us, He would have 
[Page 160, Line 7] caved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful 
[Page 160, Line 8] never prosper.”  
[Page 160, Line 9] 83. That Home of the Hereafter —We assign it 
[Page 160, Line 10] for those who seek no superiority on earth, 
[Page 160, Line 11] nor corruption. And the outcome is for the 
[Page 160, Line 12] cautious.  
[Page 160, Line 13] 84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better 
[Page 160, Line 14] than it. But whoever brings evil —the evildo-
[Page 160, Line 15] ers will be rewarded only according to what they used to do.  
[Page 160, Line 16] 85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will 
[Page 160, Line 17] return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best 
[Page 160, Line 18] who comes wi th guidance, and who is in 
[Page 160, Line 19] manifest error.”  
[Page 160, Line 20] 86. You did not expect the Scripture to be 
[Page 160, Line 21] transmitted to you, except as mercy from your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter 
[Page 160, Line 22] of the disbelievers.  
[Page 160, Line 23] 87. And do not let them divert you from Al-
[Page 160, Line 24] lah’s revelations aft er they have been revealed 
[Page 160, Line 25] to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be of the polytheists.  
[Page 160, Line 26] 88. And do not invoke with Allah any other 
[Page 160, Line 27] god. There is no god but He. All things per-
[Page 160, Line 28] ish, except His presence. His is the judgment, 
[Page 160, Line 29] and to Him you will be returned.  

[Page 160, Line 31] 29. THE SPIDER  
[Page 160, Line 32] (al-’Ankabut)  
[Page 160, Line 33] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 160, Line 34] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 160, Line 35] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 160, Line 36] 2. Have the people supposed that they will be 
[Page 160, Line 37] left alone to say, “We believe,” without being 
[Page 160, Line 38] put to the test?  
[Page 160, Line 39] 3. We have tested those before them. Allah 
[Page 160, Line 40] will surely know the truthful, and He will 
[Page 160, Line 41] surely know the liars.  4. Or do those who commit sins think they can 
[Page 160, Line 42] fool Us? Terrible is their opinion!  
[Page 160, Line 43] 5. Whoever looks forward to the meeting with 
[Page 160, Line 44] Allah —the appointed time of Allah is com-
[Page 160, Line 45] ing. He is the All -Hear ing, the All -Knowing.  
[Page 160, Line 46] 6. Whoever strives, strives only for himself. 
[Page 160, Line 47] Allah is Independent of the beings.  
[Page 160, Line 48] 7. Those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 160, Line 49] deeds —We will remit their sins, and We will 
[Page 160, Line 50] reward them according to the best of what they used to do.  
[Page 160, Line 51] 8. We have advised the human being to be 
[Page 160, Line 52] good to his parents. But if they urge you to 
[Page 160, Line 53] associate with Me something you have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is 
[Page 160, Line 54] your return; and I will inform you of what 
[Page 160, Line 55] you used to do.  
[Page 160, Line 56] 9. Those who believe and do good works —We 
[Page 160, Line 57] will admit them into the company of the 
[Page 160, Line 58] righteous.  
[Page 160, Line 59] 10. Among the people is he who says, “We 
[Page 160, Line 60] have believed in Allah.” Yet when he is harmed on Allah’s account, he equates the 
[Page 160, Line 61] people's persecution with Allah’s retribution. 
[Page 160, Line 62] And if help comes from your Lord, he says, 
[Page 160, Line 63] “We were actually with you.” Is not Allah 
[Page 160, Line 64] aware of what is inside the hearts of the peo-
[Page 160, Line 65] ple? 
[Page 160, Line 66] 11. Allah certainly knows those who believe, 
[Page 160, Line 67] and He certainly knows the hypocrites.  
[Page 160, Line 68] 12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-
[Page 160, Line 69] lieve, “Follow our way, and  we will carry your 
[Page 160, Line 70] sins.” In no way can they carry any of their sins. They are liars.  
[Page 160, Line 71] 13. They will carry their own loads, and other 
[Page 160, Line 72] loads with their own. And they will be ques-
[Page 160, Line 73] tioned on the Day of Resurrection concern-
[Page 160, Line 74] ing what they used to fabricate.  
[Page 160, Line 75] 14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed 
[Page 160, Line 76] among them for a thousand years minus fifty 
[Page 160, Line 77] years. Then the Deluge swept them; for they 
[Page 160, Line 78] were wrongdoers.  
[Page 160, Line 79] 15. But We saved him, together with the com-
[Page 160, Line 80] pany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all peoples.  
[Page 160, Line 81] 149 
[Page 161, Line 1] 29.  THE SPIDER   (al-’Ankabut)  
[Page 161, Line 2] 16. And Abr aham, when he said to his people, 
[Page 161, Line 3] “Worship Allah, and fear Him. That is better 
[Page 161, Line 4] for you, if you only knew.  
[Page 161, Line 5] 17. You worship idols besides Allah, and you 
[Page 161, Line 6] fabricate falsehoods. Those you worship, in-
[Page 161, Line 7] stead of Allah, cannot provide you with live-
[Page 161, Line 8] lihood. So seek yo ur livelihood from Allah, 
[Page 161, Line 9] and worship Him, and thank Him. To Him 
[Page 161, Line 10] you will be returned.”  
[Page 161, Line 11] 18. If you disbelieve, communities before you 
[Page 161, Line 12] have also disbelieved. The Messenger is only 
[Page 161, Line 13] responsible for clear transmission.  
[Page 161, Line 14] 19. Have they not seen how Allah originates 
[Page 161, Line 15] the creation, and then reproduces it? This is 
[Page 161, Line 16] easy for Allah.  
[Page 161, Line 17] 20. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe how He 
[Page 161, Line 18] originated the creation.” Then Allah will bring about the next existence. Allah has 
[Page 161, Line 19] power over all things.”  
[Page 161, Line 20] 21. He punishes whom He wills, and He  grants 
[Page 161, Line 21] mercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will 
[Page 161, Line 22] be restored.  
[Page 161, Line 23] 22. You cannot escape, on earth or in the 
[Page 161, Line 24] heaven; and you have no protector and no savior besides Allah.  
[Page 161, Line 25] 23. Those who disbelieved in Allah’s signs and 
[Page 161, Line 26] His encounter —these have despaired of M y 
[Page 161, Line 27] mercy. For them is a painful torment.  
[Page 161, Line 28] 24. But the only response from his people was 
[Page 161, Line 29] their saying, “Kill him, or burn him.” But Al-
[Page 161, Line 30] lah saved him from the fire. Surely in that are 
[Page 161, Line 31] signs for people who believe.  
[Page 161, Line 32] 25. And he said, “You have chosen idols in-
[Page 161, Line 33] stead  of Allah, out of affection for one an-
[Page 161, Line 34] other in the worldly life. But then, on the Day 
[Page 161, Line 35] of Resurrection, you will disown one another, 
[Page 161, Line 36] and curse one another. Your destiny is Hell, 
[Page 161, Line 37] and you will have no saviors.”  
[Page 161, Line 38] 26. Then Lot believed in him, and said, “I am 
[Page 161, Line 39] emigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the Wise.”  
[Page 161, Line 40] 27. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and 
[Page 161, Line 41] conferred on his descendants the 
[Page 161, Line 42] Prophethood and the Book, and gave him his reward in this life; and in the Hereafter he will 
[Page 161, Line 43] be among the upright.  
[Page 161, Line 44] 28. And Lot, when he said to his people, “You 
[Page 161, Line 45] are committing an obscenity not perpetrated 
[Page 161, Line 46] before you by anyone in the whole world.  
[Page 161, Line 47] 29. You approach men, and cut off the way, 
[Page 161, Line 48] and commit lewdness in your gatherings.” 
[Page 161, Line 49] But the only response from his people was to 
[Page 161, Line 50] say, “Bri ng upon us Allah’s punishment, if 
[Page 161, Line 51] you are truthful.”  
[Page 161, Line 52] 30. He said, “My Lord, help me against the 
[Page 161, Line 53] people of corruption.”  
[Page 161, Line 54] 31. And when Our envoys brought Abraham 
[Page 161, Line 55] the good news, they said, “We are going to 
[Page 161, Line 56] destroy the people of this town; its people are 
[Page 161, Line 57] wrongd oers.”  
[Page 161, Line 58] 32. He said, “Yet Lot is in it.” They said, “We 
[Page 161, Line 59] are well aware of who is in it. We will save 
[Page 161, Line 60] him, and his family, except for his wife, who 
[Page 161, Line 61] will remain behind.”  
[Page 161, Line 62] 33. Then, when Our envoys came to Lot, they 
[Page 161, Line 63] were mistreated, and he was troubled and 
[Page 161, Line 64] distressed on their account. They said, “Do 
[Page 161, Line 65] not fear, nor grieve. We will save you and 
[Page 161, Line 66] your family, except for your wife, who will re-
[Page 161, Line 67] main behind.”  
[Page 161, Line 68] 34. “We will bring down upon the people of 
[Page 161, Line 69] this town a scourge from heaven, because of 
[Page 161, Line 70] their wickedness.”  
[Page 161, Line 71] 35. And  We left behind a clear trace of it, for 
[Page 161, Line 72] people who understand.  
[Page 161, Line 73] 36. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He 
[Page 161, Line 74] said, “O my people, worship Allah and antic-
[Page 161, Line 75] ipate the Last Day, and do not spread corrup-
[Page 161, Line 76] tion in the land.”  
[Page 161, Line 77] 37. But they rejected him, so the tremor over-
[Page 161, Line 78] took them, and they were left motionless in their homes.  
[Page 161, Line 79] 38. And Aad and Thamood. It has become 
[Page 161, Line 80] clear to you from their dwellings. Satan em-
[Page 161, Line 81] bellished for them their deeds, barring them 
[Page 161, Line 82] from the path, even though they could see.  
[Page 161, Line 83] 150 
[Page 162, Line 1] 29.  THE SPIDER   (al-’Ankabut)  
[Page 162, Line 2] 39. And Quaroon, and Pharaoh, and Ha-
[Page 162, Line 3] maan— Moses went to them with clear argu-
[Page 162, Line 4] ments, but they acted arrogantly in the land. 
[Page 162, Line 5] And they could not get ahead.  
[Page 162, Line 6] 40. Each We seized by his sin. Against some 
[Page 162, Line 7] We sent a sandstorm. Some were struck by 
[Page 162, Line 8] the Blast. Some We caused the ground to cave 
[Page 162, Line 9] in beneath them. And some We drowned. It 
[Page 162, Line 10] was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who wronged their own selves.  
[Page 162, Line 11] 41. The likeness of those who take to them-
[Page 162, Line 12] selves protectors other than Allah is that of 
[Page 162, Line 13] the spider. It builds a house. But the most 
[Page 162, Line 14] fragile of houses is the spider’s house. If they 
[Page 162, Line 15] only knew.  
[Page 162, Line 16] 42. Allah knows what they invoke besides 
[Page 162, Line 17] Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise.  
[Page 162, Line 18] 43. These examples —We put them forward to 
[Page 162, Line 19] the people; but none grasps them except the 
[Page 162, Line 20] learned.  
[Page 162, Line 21] 44. Allah created the hea vens and the earth 
[Page 162, Line 22] with truth. Surely in that is a sign for the be-
[Page 162, Line 23] lievers.  
[Page 162, Line 24] 45. Recite what is revealed to you of the Scrip-
[Page 162, Line 25] ture, and perform the prayer. The prayer pre-vents indecencies and evils. And the remem-
[Page 162, Line 26] brance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows 
[Page 162, Line 27] what you do.  
[Page 162, Line 28] 46. And do not argue with the People of the 
[Page 162, Line 29] Scripture except in the best manner possible, 
[Page 162, Line 30] except those who do wrong among them. 
[Page 162, Line 31] And say, “We believe in what was revealed to 
[Page 162, Line 32] us, and in what was revealed to you; and our 
[Page 162, Line 33] God and your God is One; and to Him we are 
[Page 162, Line 34] submissive.”  
[Page 162, Line 35] 47. Likewise, We revealed to you the Scripture. 
[Page 162, Line 36] Those to whom We gave the Scripture believe 
[Page 162, Line 37] in it, and some of these believe in it. None re-
[Page 162, Line 38] nounce Our communications except the dis-
[Page 162, Line 39] believers.  
[Page 162, Line 40] 48. You did not read any scripture befo re this, 
[Page 162, Line 41] nor did you write it down with your right 
[Page 162, Line 42] hand; otherwise the falsifiers would have 
[Page 162, Line 43] doubted.  49. In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those 
[Page 162, Line 44] given knowledge. No one renounce Our signs 
[Page 162, Line 45] except the unjust.  
[Page 162, Line 46] 50. And they said, “If only a miracle from his 
[Page 162, Line 47] Lord was sent down to him.” Say, “Miracles 
[Page 162, Line 48] are only with Allah, and I am only a clear 
[Page 162, Line 49] warner.”  
[Page 162, Line 50] 51. Does it not suffice them that We revealed 
[Page 162, Line 51] to you the Scripture, which is recited to them? 
[Page 162, Line 52] In that is mercy and a reminder for people 
[Page 162, Line 53] who believe.  
[Page 162, Line 54] 52. Say, “Allah suffices as witness between you 
[Page 162, Line 55] and me. He knows everything in the heavens 
[Page 162, Line 56] and the Earth. Those who believe in vanity 
[Page 162, Line 57] and reject Allah —it is they who are the los-
[Page 162, Line 58] ers.”  
[Page 162, Line 59] 53. And they urge you to hasten the punish-
[Page 162, Line 60] ment. Were it not for a specified time, the 
[Page 162, Line 61] punishment would have come to them. But it 
[Page 162, Line 62] will come upon them suddenly, while they 
[Page 162, Line 63] are unaware.  
[Page 162, Line 64] 54. They urge you to hasten the punishment. 
[Page 162, Line 65] But Hell will engulf the disbelievers.  
[Page 162, Line 66] 55. On the Day when the punishment will en-
[Page 162, Line 67] velop them, from above  them, and from be-
[Page 162, Line 68] neath their feet, He will say, “Taste what you 
[Page 162, Line 69] used to do!”  
[Page 162, Line 70] 56. O My servants who have believed: My 
[Page 162, Line 71] earth is vast, so worship Me alone.  
[Page 162, Line 72] 57. Every soul will taste death. Then to Us you 
[Page 162, Line 73] will be returned.  
[Page 162, Line 74] 58. Those who believe and work right eous-
[Page 162, Line 75] ness—We will settle them in Paradise, in 
[Page 162, Line 76] mansions under which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. Excellent is the compensa-
[Page 162, Line 77] tion for the workers.  
[Page 162, Line 78] 59. Those who endure patiently, and in their 
[Page 162, Line 79] Lord they trust.  
[Page 162, Line 80] 60. How many a creature there is that does  not 
[Page 162, Line 81] carry its provision? Allah provides for them, 
[Page 162, Line 82] and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knowl-
[Page 162, Line 83] edgeable.  
[Page 162, Line 84] 61. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
[Page 162, Line 85] heavens and the earth and regulated the sun 
[Page 162, Line 86] 151 
[Page 163, Line 1] 30.  THE ROMANS   (ar-Rum)  
[Page 163, Line 2] and the moon?” They would say, “Allah.” 
[Page 163, Line 3] Why then do they deviate?  
[Page 163, Line 4] 62. Allah expands the provision for whomever 
[Page 163, Line 5] He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Allah 
[Page 163, Line 6] is Cognizant of all things.  
[Page 163, Line 7] 63. And if you asked them, “Who sends water 
[Page 163, Line 8] down from the sky, with which He revives the 
[Page 163, Line 9] earth after it had died?” They would say, “Al-
[Page 163, Line 10] lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of 
[Page 163, Line 11] them do not understand.  
[Page 163, Line 12] 64. The life of this world is nothing but diver-
[Page 163, Line 13] sion and play, and the Home of the Hereafter 
[Page 163, Line 14] is the Life, if they only knew.  
[Page 163, Line 15] 65. When they embark on a vessel, they pray 
[Page 163, Line 16] to Allah, devoting their faith to Him; but 
[Page 163, Line 17] once He has delivered them safely to land, 
[Page 163, Line 18] they attribute partners to Him.  
[Page 163, Line 19] 66. To be ungrateful for what We have given 
[Page 163, Line 20] them, and to enjoy themselves. They will 
[Page 163, Line 21] surely come to know.  
[Page 163, Line 22] 67. Do they not see that We established a Se-
[Page 163, Line 23] cure Sa nctuary, while all around them the 
[Page 163, Line 24] people are being carried away? Do they be-
[Page 163, Line 25] lieve in falsehood, and reject the blessings of 
[Page 163, Line 26] Allah?  
[Page 163, Line 27] 68. And who does greater wrong than he who 
[Page 163, Line 28] fabricates lies and attributes them to Allah, or 
[Page 163, Line 29] calls the truth a lie when it has  come to him? 
[Page 163, Line 30] Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the blas-phemers?  
[Page 163, Line 31] 69. As for those who strive for Us —We will 
[Page 163, Line 32] guide them in Our ways. Allah is with the do-ers of good.  

[Page 163, Line 34] 30. THE ROMANS  
[Page 163, Line 35] (ar-Rum ) 
[Page 163, Line 36] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 163, Line 37] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 163, Line 38] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 163, Line 39] 2. The Romans have been defeated.  
[Page 163, Line 40] 3. In a nearby territory. But following their de-
[Page 163, Line 41] feat, they will be victorious.  4. In a few years. The matter is up to Allah, in 
[Page 163, Line 42] the past, and in the future. On that day, the 
[Page 163, Line 43] believers will rejoice.  
[Page 163, Line 44] 5. In Allah’s support. He supports whomever 
[Page 163, Line 45] He wills. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 163, Line 46] 6. The promise of Allah— Allah never breaks 
[Page 163, Line 47] His promise, but most people do not know.  
[Page 163, Line 48] 7. They know an outer aspect of the worldly 
[Page 163, Line 49] life, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.  
[Page 163, Line 50] 8. Do they not reflect within themselves? Al-
[Page 163, Line 51] lah did not create the heavens and the earth, 
[Page 163, Line 52] and what is between them, except with rea-
[Page 163, Line 53] son, and for a specific duration. But most 
[Page 163, Line 54] people, regarding meeting their Lord, are dis-
[Page 163, Line 55] believers.  
[Page 163, Line 56] 9. Have they not travelled the earth and seen 
[Page 163, Line 57] how those before them ended up? They were 
[Page 163, Line 58] more powerful than them, and they culti-vated the land and developed it more than 
[Page 163, Line 59] they developed it, and their messengers came 
[Page 163, Line 60] to them with clear signs. Allah would never 
[Page 163, Line 61] wrong them, but they used to w rong them-
[Page 163, Line 62] selves.  
[Page 163, Line 63] 10. Then, evil was the end of those who com-
[Page 163, Line 64] mitted evil. That is because they rejected Al-
[Page 163, Line 65] lah’s revelations, and used to ridicule them.  
[Page 163, Line 66] 11. Allah originates creation, and then repeats 
[Page 163, Line 67] it. Then to Him you will be returned.  
[Page 163, Line 68] 12. On the Day when  the Hour takes place, the 
[Page 163, Line 69] guilty will despair.  
[Page 163, Line 70] 13. They will have no intercessors from among 
[Page 163, Line 71] their idols, and they will disown their part-
[Page 163, Line 72] ners.  
[Page 163, Line 73] 14. On the Day when the Hour takes place —
[Page 163, Line 74] on that Day they will separate.  
[Page 163, Line 75] 15. As for those who believed and did g ood 
[Page 163, Line 76] deeds —they will be delighted in meadows.  
[Page 163, Line 77] 16. But as for those who disbelieved, and re-
[Page 163, Line 78] jected Our signs and the encounter of the 
[Page 163, Line 79] Hereafter —those will be hauled into the tor-
[Page 163, Line 80] ment.  
[Page 163, Line 81] 17. So glorify Allah when you retire at night, 
[Page 163, Line 82] and when you rise in the morning.  
[Page 163, Line 83] 152 
[Page 164, Line 1] 30.  THE ROMANS   (ar-Rum)  
[Page 164, Line 2] 18. His is the praise in the heavens and on 
[Page 164, Line 3] earth, and in the evening, and when you 
[Page 164, Line 4] reach midday.  
[Page 164, Line 5] 19. He brings the living out of the dead, and He 
[Page 164, Line 6] brings the dead out of the living, and He re-
[Page 164, Line 7] vives the land after it had died. Likewise you 
[Page 164, Line 8] will be resur rected.  
[Page 164, Line 9] 20. And of His signs is that He created you 
[Page 164, Line 10] from dust; and behold, you become humans 
[Page 164, Line 11] spreading out.  
[Page 164, Line 12] 21. And of His signs is that He created for you 
[Page 164, Line 13] mates from among yourselves, so that you 
[Page 164, Line 14] may find tranquility in them; and He planted love and compa ssion between you. In this are 
[Page 164, Line 15] signs for people who reflect.  
[Page 164, Line 16] 22. And of His signs is the creation of the heav-
[Page 164, Line 17] ens and the earth, and the diversity of your 
[Page 164, Line 18] languages and colors. In this are signs for 
[Page 164, Line 19] those who know.  
[Page 164, Line 20] 23. And of His signs are your sleep by nig ht 
[Page 164, Line 21] and day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In 
[Page 164, Line 22] this are signs for people who listen.  
[Page 164, Line 23] 24. And of His signs is that He shows you the 
[Page 164, Line 24] lightning, causing fear and hope. And He 
[Page 164, Line 25] brings down water from the sky, and with it He revives the earth after it was dead. In this 
[Page 164, Line 26] are signs for people who understand.  
[Page 164, Line 27] 25. And of His signs is that the heaven and the 
[Page 164, Line 28] earth stand at His disposal. And then, when He calls you out of the earth, you will emerge 
[Page 164, Line 29] at once.  
[Page 164, Line 30] 26. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens 
[Page 164, Line 31] and the earth. All a re submissive to Him.  
[Page 164, Line 32] 27. It is He who initiates creation, and then re-
[Page 164, Line 33] peats it, something easy for Him. His is the 
[Page 164, Line 34] highest attribute, in the heavens and the 
[Page 164, Line 35] earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.  
[Page 164, Line 36] 28. He illustrates an example for you, from 
[Page 164, Line 37] your own selves: d o you make your servants 
[Page 164, Line 38] full partners in the wealth We have given 
[Page 164, Line 39] you? Do you revere them as you revere one 
[Page 164, Line 40] another? We thus explain the revelations for 
[Page 164, Line 41] a people who understand.  
[Page 164, Line 42] 29. Yet the wrongdoers follow their desires 
[Page 164, Line 43] without knowledge. But who can gu ide whom Allah leaves astray? They will have no 
[Page 164, Line 44] helpers.  
[Page 164, Line 45] 30. So devote yourself to the religion of mono-
[Page 164, Line 46] theism —the natural instinct Allah has in-
[Page 164, Line 47] stilled in mankind. There is no altering Al-
[Page 164, Line 48] lah’s creation. This is the true religion, but most people do not know . 
[Page 164, Line 49] 31. Turning towards Him —and be conscious 
[Page 164, Line 50] of Him, and perform the prayer, and do not 
[Page 164, Line 51] be of the idolaters.  
[Page 164, Line 52] 32. Of those who divided their religion, and 
[Page 164, Line 53] became sects; each faction pleased with what they have.  
[Page 164, Line 54] 33. When affliction touches the people, they 
[Page 164, Line 55] call on their Lord, turning to Him in repent-
[Page 164, Line 56] ance. But then, when He gives them a taste of 
[Page 164, Line 57] His mercy, some of them attribute partners to 
[Page 164, Line 58] their Lord.  
[Page 164, Line 59] 34. To show ingratitude for what We have 
[Page 164, Line 60] given them. Indulge yourselves —you will 
[Page 164, Line 61] surely know.  
[Page 164, Line 62] 35. Have We sent down to them any authority, 
[Page 164, Line 63] which speaks in support of their idols?  
[Page 164, Line 64] 36. When We give people a taste of mercy, they 
[Page 164, Line 65] rejoice in it. But when adversity befalls them, 
[Page 164, Line 66] because of what their hands have perpetrated, 
[Page 164, Line 67] they begin to despair.  
[Page 164, Line 68] 37. Do they not see that Allah expands the pro-
[Page 164, Line 69] vision for whomever He wills, or restricts it? 
[Page 164, Line 70] Surely in this are signs for people who be-
[Page 164, Line 71] lieve.  
[Page 164, Line 72] 38. So give the relative his rights, and the des-
[Page 164, Line 73] titute, and the wayfarer. That is best for those 
[Page 164, Line 74] who seek Allah’s presence. Those are the 
[Page 164, Line 75] prosperous.  
[Page 164, Line 76] 39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby to 
[Page 164, Line 77] multiply people’s wealth, will not multiply 
[Page 164, Line 78] with Allah. But what you give in charity, de-siring Allah’s approval —these are the multi-
[Page 164, Line 79] pliers.  
[Page 164, Line 80] 40. Allah is He who created you, then provides 
[Page 164, Line 81] for you, then makes you die, then brings you 
[Page 164, Line 82] back to life. Can any of your idols do any of 
[Page 164, Line 83] that? Glorified is He, and Exalted above what 
[Page 164, Line 84] they associate.  
[Page 164, Line 85] 153 
[Page 165, Line 1] 31.  LUQMAN   (Luqman)  
[Page 165, Line 2] 41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, 
[Page 165, Line 3] because of what people’s hands have earned, 
[Page 165, Line 4] in order to make them tas te some of what 
[Page 165, Line 5] they have done, so that they might return.  
[Page 165, Line 6] 42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate 
[Page 165, Line 7] of those who came before. Most of them were 
[Page 165, Line 8] idolaters.”  
[Page 165, Line 9] 43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, 
[Page 165, Line 10] before there comes from Allah a Day that 
[Page 165, Line 11] canno t be averted. On that Day, they will be 
[Page 165, Line 12] shocked.  
[Page 165, Line 13] 44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his 
[Page 165, Line 14] disbelief. And whoever acts righteously —
[Page 165, Line 15] they are preparing for themselves.  
[Page 165, Line 16] 45. So that He may reward those who have be-
[Page 165, Line 17] lieved and done the righteous deeds out of 
[Page 165, Line 18] His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un-
[Page 165, Line 19] grateful.  
[Page 165, Line 20] 46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds 
[Page 165, Line 21] bearing good news, to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek of His 
[Page 165, Line 22] bounty, and so that you m ay give thanks.  
[Page 165, Line 23] 47. Before you, We sent messengers to their 
[Page 165, Line 24] people. They came to them with clear proofs. Then We took revenge on those who sinned. 
[Page 165, Line 25] It is incumbent on Us to help the believers.  
[Page 165, Line 26] 48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir 
[Page 165, Line 27] up clouds. Then H e spreads them in the sky 
[Page 165, Line 28] as He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then 
[Page 165, Line 29] you see rain drops issuing from their midst. 
[Page 165, Line 30] Then, when He makes it fall upon whom He 
[Page 165, Line 31] wills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.  
[Page 165, Line 32] 49. Although they were before this —before it 
[Page 165, Line 33] was sent d own upon them —in despair.  
[Page 165, Line 34] 50. So observe the effects of Allah’s mercy —
[Page 165, Line 35] how He revives the earth after it was dead. In-
[Page 165, Line 36] deed, He is the Reviver of the dead. He is Ca-
[Page 165, Line 37] pable of everything.  
[Page 165, Line 38] 51. But if We send a wind, and they see it turn-
[Page 165, Line 39] ing things yellow, they would continue there-
[Page 165, Line 40] after to disbelieve.  
[Page 165, Line 41] 52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can 
[Page 165, Line 42] you make the deaf hear the call when they 
[Page 165, Line 43] turn away.  53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er-
[Page 165, Line 44] ror. You can make hear only those who be-
[Page 165, Line 45] lieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.  
[Page 165, Line 46] 54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af-
[Page 165, Line 47] ter weakness gave you strength, then after 
[Page 165, Line 48] strength gave you weakness and gray hair. He 
[Page 165, Line 49] creates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci-
[Page 165, Line 50] ent, the Omnipotent.  
[Page 165, Line 51] 55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the 
[Page 165, Line 52] sinners will swear they had stayed but an 
[Page 165, Line 53] hour. Thus they were deluded.  
[Page 165, Line 54] 56. But those endowed with knowledge and 
[Page 165, Line 55] faith will say, “You remained in Allah’s Book 
[Page 165, Line 56] until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day 
[Page 165, Line 57] of Resurrection, but you did not know.”  
[Page 165, Line 58] 57. On that  Day, the sinners’ excuses will not 
[Page 165, Line 59] benefit them, nor will they be excused.  
[Page 165, Line 60] 58. We have cited in this Quran for the people 
[Page 165, Line 61] every sort of parable. But even if you bring 
[Page 165, Line 62] them a miracle, those who disbelieve will say, 
[Page 165, Line 63] “You are nothing but fakers.”  
[Page 165, Line 64] 59. Allah t hus seals the hearts of those who do 
[Page 165, Line 65] not know.  
[Page 165, Line 66] 60. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
[Page 165, Line 67] And do not let those who lack certainty belit-tle you.  

[Page 165, Line 69] 31. LUQMAN  
[Page 165, Line 70] (Luqman ) 
[Page 165, Line 71] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 165, Line 72] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 165, Line 73] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 165, Line 74] 2. These are the Verses of the Wise Book.  
[Page 165, Line 75] 3. A guide and a mercy for the righteous.  
[Page 165, Line 76] 4. Those who observe the prayer, and pay the 
[Page 165, Line 77] obligatory charity, and are certain of the 
[Page 165, Line 78] Hereafter.  
[Page 165, Line 79] 5. These are upon guidance from their Lord. 
[Page 165, Line 80] These are the successful.  
[Page 165, Line 81] 6. Among the pe ople is he who trades in dis-
[Page 165, Line 82] tracting tales; intending, without knowledge, 
[Page 165, Line 83] to lead away from Allah’s way, and to make a 
[Page 165, Line 84] 154 
[Page 166, Line 1] 31.  LUQMAN   (Luqman)  
[Page 166, Line 2] mockery of it. These will have a humiliating 
[Page 166, Line 3] punishment.  
[Page 166, Line 4] 7. And when Our Verses are recited to him, he 
[Page 166, Line 5] turns away in pride, as though he did not hear 
[Page 166, Line 6] them, as though there is deafness in his ears. 
[Page 166, Line 7] So inform him of a painful punishment.  
[Page 166, Line 8] 8. As for those who believe and do good 
[Page 166, Line 9] deeds —for them are the Gardens of Bliss.  
[Page 166, Line 10] 9. Dwelling therein forever. The promise of 
[Page 166, Line 11] Allah is true. He is the Mighty,  the Wise.  
[Page 166, Line 12] 10. He created the heavens without pillars that 
[Page 166, Line 13] you can see, and placed stabilizers on earth 
[Page 166, Line 14] lest it shifts with you, and scattered through-
[Page 166, Line 15] out it all kinds of creatures. And from the sky 
[Page 166, Line 16] We sent down water, and caused to grow 
[Page 166, Line 17] therein of every no ble pair.  
[Page 166, Line 18] 11. Such is Allah’s creation. Now show me 
[Page 166, Line 19] what those besides Him have created. In fact, 
[Page 166, Line 20] the wicked are in obvious error.  
[Page 166, Line 21] 12. We endowed Luqman with wisdom: “Give 
[Page 166, Line 22] thanks to Allah.” Whoever is appreciative —
[Page 166, Line 23] is appreciative for the benefit of his own  soul. 
[Page 166, Line 24] And whoever is unappreciative —Allah is 
[Page 166, Line 25] Sufficient and Praiseworthy.  
[Page 166, Line 26] 13. When Luqman said to his son, as he ad-
[Page 166, Line 27] vised him, “O my son, do not associate any-
[Page 166, Line 28] thing with Allah, for idolatry is a terrible 
[Page 166, Line 29] wrong.”  
[Page 166, Line 30] 14. We have entrusted the human being with 
[Page 166, Line 31] the care of his parents. His mother carried 
[Page 166, Line 32] him through hardship upon hardship, wean-
[Page 166, Line 33] ing him in two years. So give thanks to Me, 
[Page 166, Line 34] and to your parents. To Me is the destination.  
[Page 166, Line 35] 15. But if they strive to have you associate with 
[Page 166, Line 36] Me something of which you have no  
[Page 166, Line 37] knowledge, do not obey them. But keep them 
[Page 166, Line 38] company in this life, in kindness, and follow 
[Page 166, Line 39] the path of him who turns to Me. Then to Me 
[Page 166, Line 40] is your return; and I will inform you of what 
[Page 166, Line 41] you used to do.  
[Page 166, Line 42] 16. “O my son, even if it were the weight of a 
[Page 166, Line 43] mustard -seed,  in a rock, or in the heavens, or 
[Page 166, Line 44] on earth, Allah will bring it to light. Allah is Kind and Expert.  17. O my son, observe the prayer, advocate 
[Page 166, Line 45] righteousness, forbid evil, and be patient over 
[Page 166, Line 46] what has befallen you. These are of the most 
[Page 166, Line 47] honorable traits.  
[Page 166, Line 48] 18. And do not treat people with arrogance, 
[Page 166, Line 49] nor walk proudly on earth. Allah does not 
[Page 166, Line 50] love the arrogant showoffs.  
[Page 166, Line 51] 19. And moderate your stride, and lower your 
[Page 166, Line 52] voice. The most repulsive of voices is the 
[Page 166, Line 53] donkey’s voice.”  
[Page 166, Line 54] 20. Do you not see how Allah placed at your 
[Page 166, Line 55] service everything in the heavens and the 
[Page 166, Line 56] earth? How He showered you with His bless-ings, both outward and inward? Yet among 
[Page 166, Line 57] the people is he who argues about Allah with-
[Page 166, Line 58] out knowledge, without guidance, and with-
[Page 166, Line 59] out an enlightening Scripture.  
[Page 166, Line 60] 21. And whe n it is said to them, “Follow what 
[Page 166, Line 61] Allah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we fol-
[Page 166, Line 62] low what we found our parents devoted to.” Even if Satan is calling them to the suffering 
[Page 166, Line 63] of the Blaze?  
[Page 166, Line 64] 22. Whoever submits himself wholly to Allah, 
[Page 166, Line 65] and is a doer of good, ha s grasped the most 
[Page 166, Line 66] trustworthy handle. With Allah rests the out-
[Page 166, Line 67] come of all events.  
[Page 166, Line 68] 23. Whoever disbelieves —let not his disbelief 
[Page 166, Line 69] sadden you. To Us is their return. Then We will inform them of what they did. Allah 
[Page 166, Line 70] knows what lies within the hearts.  
[Page 166, Line 71] 24. We g ive them a little comfort; then We 
[Page 166, Line 72] compel them to a harsh torment.  
[Page 166, Line 73] 25. And if you ask them, “Who created the 
[Page 166, Line 74] heavens and the earth?” They will say, “Al-
[Page 166, Line 75] lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of 
[Page 166, Line 76] them do not know.  
[Page 166, Line 77] 26. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens 
[Page 166, Line 78] and the earth. Allah is the Rich, the Praised.  
[Page 166, Line 79] 27. If all the trees on earth were pens, filled by 
[Page 166, Line 80] the ocean, with seven more oceans besides, 
[Page 166, Line 81] the Words of Allah would not run out. Allah 
[Page 166, Line 82] is Majestic and Wise.  
[Page 166, Line 83] 28. Your creation and your resurrection are 
[Page 166, Line 84] only as a single soul. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
[Page 166, Line 85] 155 
[Page 167, Line 1] 32.  PROSTRATION   (as-Sajdah)  
[Page 167, Line 2] 29. Have you not seen how Allah merges the 
[Page 167, Line 3] night into the day, and merges the day into 
[Page 167, Line 4] the night? That He subjected the sun and the 
[Page 167, Line 5] moon, each running for a stated term? And 
[Page 167, Line 6] that Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?  
[Page 167, Line 7] 30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and 
[Page 167, Line 8] what they worship besides Him is falsehood, 
[Page 167, Line 9] and because Allah is the Exalted, the Su-
[Page 167, Line 10] preme.  
[Page 167, Line 11] 31. Have you not seen how the ships sail 
[Page 167, Line 12] through the sea, by the grace of Allah, to 
[Page 167, Line 13] show you of His wonders? In that are signs 
[Page 167, Line 14] for every persevering, thankful person.  
[Page 167, Line 15] 32. When waves, like canopies, cover them, 
[Page 167, Line 16] they call upon Allah, devoting their religion 
[Page 167, Line 17] to Him. But when He has delivered them to 
[Page 167, Line 18] dry land, some of them waver. No one re-
[Page 167, Line 19] nounces Our revelat ions except the treacher-
[Page 167, Line 20] ous blasphemer.  
[Page 167, Line 21] 33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and 
[Page 167, Line 22] dread a Day when no parent can avail his child, nor can a child avail his parent, in any-
[Page 167, Line 23] thing. The promise of Allah is true. There-
[Page 167, Line 24] fore, do not let this life deceive you, n or let 
[Page 167, Line 25] illusions deceive you regarding Allah.  
[Page 167, Line 26] 34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the 
[Page 167, Line 27] Hour. He sends down the rain, and He knows what the wombs contain. No soul knows 
[Page 167, Line 28] what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul 
[Page 167, Line 29] knows in what land it will die. Allah is All-
[Page 167, Line 30] Knowing, Well -Informed.  

[Page 167, Line 32] 32. PROSTRATION  
[Page 167, Line 33] (as-Sajdah ) 
[Page 167, Line 34] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 167, Line 35] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 167, Line 36] 1. Alif, Lam, Meem.  
[Page 167, Line 37] 2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt, 
[Page 167, Line 38] is from the Lord of the Universe.  
[Page 167, Line 39] 3. Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is 
[Page 167, Line 40] the Truth from your Lord, to warn a people 
[Page 167, Line 41] who received no warner before you, that they 
[Page 167, Line 42] may be guided.  4. Allah is He who created the heavens and the 
[Page 167, Line 43] earth and everything between them in six 
[Page 167, Line 44] days, and then established Himself on the 
[Page 167, Line 45] Throne. Apart from Him, you  have no mas-
[Page 167, Line 46] ter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?  
[Page 167, Line 47] 5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to 
[Page 167, Line 48] the earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day 
[Page 167, Line 49] the length of which is a thousand years by 
[Page 167, Line 50] your count.  
[Page 167, Line 51] 6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the 
[Page 167, Line 52] Visible, the Powerful, the Merciful.   
[Page 167, Line 53] 7. He who perfected everything He created, 
[Page 167, Line 54] and originated the creation of man from clay.  
[Page 167, Line 55] 8. Then made his reproduction from an ex-
[Page 167, Line 56] tract of an insignificant fluid.  
[Page 167, Line 57] 9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed 
[Page 167, Line 58] into him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the 
[Page 167, Line 59] hearing, and the eyesight, and the brains —
[Page 167, Line 60] but rarely do you give thanks.  
[Page 167, Line 61] 10. And they say, “When we are lost into the 
[Page 167, Line 62] earth, shall we be in a new creation?” In fact, 
[Page 167, Line 63] they deny the meeting with their Lord.  
[Page 167, Line 64] 11. Say, “The angel of death put in charge of 
[Page 167, Line 65] you will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you 
[Page 167, Line 66] will be returned.”  
[Page 167, Line 67] 12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing 
[Page 167, Line 68] their heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we 
[Page 167, Line 69] have seen and we have heard, so send us back, 
[Page 167, Line 70] and we will act righteously; we ar e now con-
[Page 167, Line 71] vinced.”  
[Page 167, Line 72] 13. Had We willed, We could have given every 
[Page 167, Line 73] soul its guidance, but the declaration from Me will come true: “I will fill Hell with jinn 
[Page 167, Line 74] and humans, altogether.”  
[Page 167, Line 75] 14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of 
[Page 167, Line 76] this Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so 
[Page 167, Line 77] taste the eternal torment for what you used to 
[Page 167, Line 78] do. 
[Page 167, Line 79] 15. They believe in Our communications, 
[Page 167, Line 80] those who, when reminded of them, fall 
[Page 167, Line 81] down prostrate, and glorify their Lord with 
[Page 167, Line 82] praise, and are not proud.  
[Page 167, Line 83] 16. Their sides shun their beds, as t hey pray to 
[Page 167, Line 84] their Lord, out of reverence and hope; and 
[Page 167, Line 85] from Our provisions to them, they give.  
[Page 167, Line 86] 156 
[Page 168, Line 1] 33.  THE CONFEDERATES   (al-Ahzab)  
[Page 168, Line 2] 17. No soul knows what eye’s delight awaits 
[Page 168, Line 3] them —a reward for what they used to do.  
[Page 168, Line 4] 18. Is someone who is faithful like someone 
[Page 168, Line 5] who is a sinner? They are not equal.  
[Page 168, Line 6] 19. As for those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 168, Line 7] deeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter —
[Page 168, Line 8] hospitality for what they used to do.  
[Page 168, Line 9] 20. But as for those who transgressed, their 
[Page 168, Line 10] shelter is the Fire. Every time they try to get 
[Page 168, Line 11] out of it, they will be broug ht back into it, and 
[Page 168, Line 12] it will be said to them, “Taste the suffering of 
[Page 168, Line 13] the Fire which you used to deny.”  
[Page 168, Line 14] 21. We will make them taste the lesser tor-
[Page 168, Line 15] ment, prior to the greater torment, so that 
[Page 168, Line 16] they may return.  
[Page 168, Line 17] 22. Who is more wrong than he, who, when 
[Page 168, Line 18] reminded  of his Lord’s revelations, turns 
[Page 168, Line 19] away from them? We will certainly wreak vengeance upon the criminals.  
[Page 168, Line 20] 23. We gave Moses the Book; so do not be in 
[Page 168, Line 21] doubt regarding His encounter; and We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel.  
[Page 168, Line 22] 24. And We appointed le aders from among 
[Page 168, Line 23] them, guiding by Our command, as long as 
[Page 168, Line 24] they persevered and were certain of Our 
[Page 168, Line 25] communications.  
[Page 168, Line 26] 25. Your Lord will judge between them on the 
[Page 168, Line 27] Day of Resurrection regarding everything 
[Page 168, Line 28] they had disputed.  
[Page 168, Line 29] 26. Is it not a lesson for them, how many gen-
[Page 168, Line 30] erations We have destroyed before them, in whose habitations they walk? Surely in that 
[Page 168, Line 31] are signs. Do they not hear?  
[Page 168, Line 32] 27. Do they not see how We conduct the water 
[Page 168, Line 33] to a dry land, and with it We produce vegeta-
[Page 168, Line 34] tion, from which their livestock eat, and 
[Page 168, Line 35] themselves? Do they not see?  
[Page 168, Line 36] 28. And they say, “When is this victory, if you 
[Page 168, Line 37] are truthful?”  
[Page 168, Line 38] 29. Say, “On the day of victory, the faith of 
[Page 168, Line 39] those who disbelieved will be of no avail to 
[Page 168, Line 40] them, and they will not be granted respite.”  
[Page 168, Line 41] 30. So turn away from them, a nd wait. They 
[Page 168, Line 42] too are waiting.    
[Page 168, Line 43] 33. THE CONFEDERATES  
[Page 168, Line 44] (al-Ahzab ) 
[Page 168, Line 45] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 168, Line 46] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 168, Line 47] 1. O Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the 
[Page 168, Line 48] unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is 
[Page 168, Line 49] Knowledgeable and Wise.  
[Page 168, Line 50] 2. And follow what is revealed to you from 
[Page 168, Line 51] your Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you do. 
[Page 168, Line 52] 3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough 
[Page 168, Line 53] as a trustee.  
[Page 168, Line 54] 4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any 
[Page 168, Line 55] man's body. Nor did He make your wives 
[Page 168, Line 56] whom you equate with your mothers, your actual mot hers. Nor did He make your 
[Page 168, Line 57] adopted sons, your actual sons. These are your words coming out of your mouths. Al-
[Page 168, Line 58] lah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.  
[Page 168, Line 59] 5. Call them after their fathers; that is more 
[Page 168, Line 60] equitable with Allah. But if you do not know 
[Page 168, Line 61] their fathers, then your brethren in faith and 
[Page 168, Line 62] your friends. There is no blame on you if you 
[Page 168, Line 63] err therein, barring what your hearts pre-
[Page 168, Line 64] meditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 168, Line 65] 6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers 
[Page 168, Line 66] than they are of themselves, and his wives are 
[Page 168, Line 67] mothers to them. And blood -relatives are 
[Page 168, Line 68] closer to one another in Allah’s Book than the 
[Page 168, Line 69] believers or the emigrants, though you 
[Page 168, Line 70] should do good to your friends. That is in-
[Page 168, Line 71] scribed in the Book.  
[Page 168, Line 72] 7. Recall that We received a pledge from the 
[Page 168, Line 73] prophets, a nd from you, and from Noah, and 
[Page 168, Line 74] Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. We received from them a solemn pledge.  
[Page 168, Line 75] 8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin-
[Page 168, Line 76] cerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a 
[Page 168, Line 77] painful punishment.  
[Page 168, Line 78] 9. O you who believe! Remember Allah’s 
[Page 168, Line 79] blessings upon you, when forces came against you, and We sent against them a wind, and 
[Page 168, Line 80] 157 
[Page 169, Line 1] 33.  THE CONFEDERATES   (al-Ahzab)  
[Page 169, Line 2] forces you did not see. Allah is Observant of 
[Page 169, Line 3] what you do.  
[Page 169, Line 4] 10. When they came upon you, from above 
[Page 169, Line 5] you, and from beneath you; and the eyes be-
[Page 169, Line 6] came dazed, and th e hearts reached the 
[Page 169, Line 7] throats, and you harbored doubts about Al-
[Page 169, Line 8] lah. 
[Page 169, Line 9] 11. There and then the believers were tested, 
[Page 169, Line 10] and were shaken most severely.  
[Page 169, Line 11] 12. When the hypocrites and those in whose 
[Page 169, Line 12] hearts is sickness said, “Allah and His Mes-
[Page 169, Line 13] senger promised us nothing  but illusion.”  
[Page 169, Line 14] 13. And when a group of them said, “O people 
[Page 169, Line 15] of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so re-treat.” And a faction of them asked the 
[Page 169, Line 16] Prophet to excuse them, saying, “Our homes 
[Page 169, Line 17] are exposed,” although they were not ex-
[Page 169, Line 18] posed. They only wanted to flee . 
[Page 169, Line 19] 14. Had it been invaded from its sides, and 
[Page 169, Line 20] they were asked to dissent, they would have 
[Page 169, Line 21] done so with little hesitation.  
[Page 169, Line 22] 15. Although they had made a pledged to Al-
[Page 169, Line 23] lah, in the past, that they will not turn their 
[Page 169, Line 24] backs. A pledge to Allah is a responsibility . 
[Page 169, Line 25] 16. Say, “Flight will not benefit you, if you flee 
[Page 169, Line 26] from death or killing, even then you will be 
[Page 169, Line 27] given only brief enjoyment.”  
[Page 169, Line 28] 17. Say, “Who is it who will shield you from 
[Page 169, Line 29] Allah, if He intends adversity for you, or in-
[Page 169, Line 30] tends mercy for you?” Besides Allah, they will 
[Page 169, Line 31] find for themselves neither friend nor helper.  
[Page 169, Line 32] 18. Allah already knows the hinderers among 
[Page 169, Line 33] you, and those who say to their brethren, 
[Page 169, Line 34] “Come and join us.” Rarely do they mobilize 
[Page 169, Line 35] for battle.  
[Page 169, Line 36] 19. Being stingy towards you. And when fear 
[Page 169, Line 37] approaches, y ou see them staring at you —
[Page 169, Line 38] their eyes rolling —like someone fainting at 
[Page 169, Line 39] death. Then, when panic is over, they whip 
[Page 169, Line 40] you with sharp tongues. They resent you any 
[Page 169, Line 41] good. These have never believed, so Allah has 
[Page 169, Line 42] nullified their works; a matter easy for Allah.  
[Page 169, Line 43] 20. They assumed that the confederates had 
[Page 169, Line 44] not withdrawn. But were the confederates to advance, they would wish they were in the de-
[Page 169, Line 45] sert with the Bedouins, inquiring about your 
[Page 169, Line 46] news. And if they were among you, they 
[Page 169, Line 47] would have done little fighting.  
[Page 169, Line 48] 21. You have  an excellent example in the Mes-
[Page 169, Line 49] senger of Allah; for anyone who seeks Allah 
[Page 169, Line 50] and the Last Day, and remembers Allah fre-
[Page 169, Line 51] quently.  
[Page 169, Line 52] 22. And when the believers saw the confeder-
[Page 169, Line 53] ates, they said, “This is what Allah and His 
[Page 169, Line 54] messenger have promised us; and Allah and 
[Page 169, Line 55] His messenger have told the truth.” And it 
[Page 169, Line 56] only increased them in faith and submission.  
[Page 169, Line 57] 23. Of the believers are men who are true to 
[Page 169, Line 58] what they pledged to Allah. Some of them 
[Page 169, Line 59] have fulfilled their vows; and some are still 
[Page 169, Line 60] waiting, and never wavering.  
[Page 169, Line 61] 24. That Allah may reward the truthful for 
[Page 169, Line 62] their truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites, 
[Page 169, Line 63] if He wills, or pardon them. Allah is Forgiv-
[Page 169, Line 64] ing and Merciful.  
[Page 169, Line 65] 25. Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage; 
[Page 169, Line 66] they gained no advantage. Allah thus spared 
[Page 169, Line 67] the believers co mbat. Allah is Strong and 
[Page 169, Line 68] Mighty.  
[Page 169, Line 69] 26. And He brought down from their strong-
[Page 169, Line 70] holds those of the People of the Book who backed them, and He threw terror into their hearts. Some of them you killed, and others you took captive.  
[Page 169, Line 71] 27. And He made you inherit their  land, and 
[Page 169, Line 72] their homes, and their possessions, and a re-
[Page 169, Line 73] gion you have never stepped on. Allah has 
[Page 169, Line 74] power over all things.  
[Page 169, Line 75] 28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire 
[Page 169, Line 76] the life of this world and its finery, then let me 
[Page 169, Line 77] compensate you, and release you kind ly. 
[Page 169, Line 78] 29. But if you desire Allah, His Messenger, and 
[Page 169, Line 79] the Home of the Hereafter, then Allah has 
[Page 169, Line 80] prepared for the righteous among you a mag-
[Page 169, Line 81] nificent compensation.”  
[Page 169, Line 82] 30. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you 
[Page 169, Line 83] commits a proven indecency, the punish-
[Page 169, Line 84] ment for her wi ll be doubled. And that would 
[Page 169, Line 85] be easy for Allah.  
[Page 169, Line 86] 158 
[Page 170, Line 1] 33.  THE CONFEDERATES   (al-Ahzab)  
[Page 170, Line 2] 31. But whoever of you remains obedient to 
[Page 170, Line 3] Allah and His Messenger, and acts right-
[Page 170, Line 4] eously, We will give her a double reward; and 
[Page 170, Line 5] We have prepared for her a generous provi-
[Page 170, Line 6] sion.  
[Page 170, Line 7] 32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like 
[Page 170, Line 8] any other women, if you observe piety. So do 
[Page 170, Line 9] not speak too softly, lest the sick at heart lusts 
[Page 170, Line 10] after you, but speak in an appropriate man-ner. 
[Page 170, Line 11] 33. And settle in your homes; and do not dis-
[Page 170, Line 12] play yourselves, as in the former days of igno-
[Page 170, Line 13] rance. And  perform the prayer, and give reg-
[Page 170, Line 14] ular charity, and obey Allah and His Messen-
[Page 170, Line 15] ger. Allah desires to remove all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and to pu-
[Page 170, Line 16] rify you thoroughly.  
[Page 170, Line 17] 34. And remember what is recited in your 
[Page 170, Line 18] homes of Allah's revelations a nd wisdom. Al-
[Page 170, Line 19] lah is Kind and Informed.  
[Page 170, Line 20] 35. Muslim men and Muslim women, believ-
[Page 170, Line 21] ing men and believing women, obedient men and obedient women, truthful men and truthful women, patient men and patient 
[Page 170, Line 22] women, humble men and humble women, 
[Page 170, Line 23] charitable men and char itable women, fast-
[Page 170, Line 24] ing men and fasting women, men who guard 
[Page 170, Line 25] their chastity and women who guard, men 
[Page 170, Line 26] who remember Allah frequently and women 
[Page 170, Line 27] who remember —Allah has prepared for 
[Page 170, Line 28] them a pardon, and an immense reward.  
[Page 170, Line 29] 36. It is not for any believer, man or woma n, 
[Page 170, Line 30] when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, to have liberty of choice in their de-
[Page 170, Line 31] cision. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes-
[Page 170, Line 32] senger has gone far astray.  
[Page 170, Line 33] 37. When you said to him whom Allah had 
[Page 170, Line 34] blessed, and you had favored, “Keep your 
[Page 170, Line 35] wife to yours elf, and fear Allah.” But you hid 
[Page 170, Line 36] within yourself what Allah was to reveal. And 
[Page 170, Line 37] you feared the people, but it was Allah you 
[Page 170, Line 38] were supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid 
[Page 170, Line 39] ended his relationship with her, We gave her 
[Page 170, Line 40] to you in marriage, that there may be no re-
[Page 170, Line 41] stric tion for believers regarding the wives of 
[Page 170, Line 42] their adopted sons, when their relationship has ended. The command of Allah was ful-
[Page 170, Line 43] filled.  
[Page 170, Line 44] 38. There is no blame on the Prophet regard-
[Page 170, Line 45] ing what Allah has ordained for him. Such is 
[Page 170, Line 46] the pattern of Allah among those wh o passed 
[Page 170, Line 47] before. The command of Allah is an absolute 
[Page 170, Line 48] decree.  
[Page 170, Line 49] 39. Those who deliver the messages of Allah, 
[Page 170, Line 50] and fear Him, and never fear anyone except 
[Page 170, Line 51] Allah. Allah is sufficient as a reckoner.  
[Page 170, Line 52] 40. Muhammad is not the father of any of your 
[Page 170, Line 53] men; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and 
[Page 170, Line 54] the seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of 
[Page 170, Line 55] everything.  
[Page 170, Line 56] 41. O you who believe, remember Allah with 
[Page 170, Line 57] frequent remembrance.  
[Page 170, Line 58] 42. And glorify Him morning and evening.  
[Page 170, Line 59] 43. It is He who reaches out to you, and His 
[Page 170, Line 60] angels, to bring you out of darkness into the 
[Page 170, Line 61] light. And He is Ever -Merciful towards the 
[Page 170, Line 62] believers.  
[Page 170, Line 63] 44. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him 
[Page 170, Line 64] is, “Peace,” and He has prepared for them a generous reward.  
[Page 170, Line 65] 45. O prophet! We have sent you as a witness, 
[Page 170, Line 66] and a bearer of good news,  and a warner.  
[Page 170, Line 67] 46. And a caller towards Allah by His leave, 
[Page 170, Line 68] and an illuminating beacon.  
[Page 170, Line 69] 47. And give the believers the good news that 
[Page 170, Line 70] for them is a great reward.  
[Page 170, Line 71] 48. And do not obey the blasphemers and the 
[Page 170, Line 72] hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely on Allah. Allah is a sufficient protector.  
[Page 170, Line 73] 49. O you who believe! When you marry be-
[Page 170, Line 74] lieving women, but then divorce them before 
[Page 170, Line 75] you have touched them, there is no waiting 
[Page 170, Line 76] period for you to observe in respect to them; 
[Page 170, Line 77] but compensate them, and release them in a  
[Page 170, Line 78] graceful manner.  
[Page 170, Line 79] 50. O Prophet! We have permitted to you your 
[Page 170, Line 80] wives to whom you have given their dowries, and those you already have, as granted to you 
[Page 170, Line 81] by Allah, and the daughters of your paternal 
[Page 170, Line 82] uncle, and the daughters of your paternal 
[Page 170, Line 83] 159 
[Page 171, Line 1] 33.  THE CONFEDERATES   (al-Ahzab)  
[Page 171, Line 2] aunts, and the d aughters of your maternal 
[Page 171, Line 3] uncle, and the daughters of your maternal 
[Page 171, Line 4] aunts who emigrated with you, and a believ-
[Page 171, Line 5] ing woman who has offered herself to the 
[Page 171, Line 6] Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her, 
[Page 171, Line 7] exclusively for you, and not for the believers. 
[Page 171, Line 8] We know wha t We have ordained for them 
[Page 171, Line 9] regarding their wives and those their right -
[Page 171, Line 10] hands possess. This is to spare you any diffi-
[Page 171, Line 11] culty. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 171, Line 12] 51. You may defer any of them you wish, and 
[Page 171, Line 13] receive any of them you wish. Should you de-
[Page 171, Line 14] sire any of those you had deferred, there is no 
[Page 171, Line 15] blame on you. This is more proper, so that 
[Page 171, Line 16] they will be comforted, and not be grieved, 
[Page 171, Line 17] and be content with what you have given 
[Page 171, Line 18] each one of them. Allah knows what is within 
[Page 171, Line 19] your hearts. Allah is Omniscient and Clem-
[Page 171, Line 20] ent. 
[Page 171, Line 21] 52. Beyond that, no other women are permis-
[Page 171, Line 22] sible for you, nor can you exchange them for 
[Page 171, Line 23] other wives, even if you admire their beauty, 
[Page 171, Line 24] except those you already have. Allah is 
[Page 171, Line 25] Watchful over all things.  
[Page 171, Line 26] 53. O you who believe! Do not enter the homes 
[Page 171, Line 27] of the Prophe t, unless you are given permis-
[Page 171, Line 28] sion to come for a meal; and do not wait for 
[Page 171, Line 29] its preparation. And when you are invited, go 
[Page 171, Line 30] in. And when you have eaten, disperse, with-
[Page 171, Line 31] out lingering for conversation. This irritates 
[Page 171, Line 32] the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but 
[Page 171, Line 33] Allah does not shy away from the truth. And 
[Page 171, Line 34] when you ask his wives for something, ask 
[Page 171, Line 35] them from behind a screen; that is purer for 
[Page 171, Line 36] your hearts and their hearts. You must never 
[Page 171, Line 37] offend the Messenger of Allah, nor must you 
[Page 171, Line 38] ever marry his wives after him, for that would 
[Page 171, Line 39] be an enormity with Allah.  
[Page 171, Line 40] 54. Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, Al-
[Page 171, Line 41] lah is Aware of all things.  
[Page 171, Line 42] 55. There is no blame on them concerning 
[Page 171, Line 43] their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, 
[Page 171, Line 44] or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, 
[Page 171, Line 45] or their women, or their female servants. But 
[Page 171, Line 46] they should remain conscious of Allah. Allah 
[Page 171, Line 47] is Witness over all things.  56. Allah and His angels give blessings to the 
[Page 171, Line 48] Prophet. O you who believe, call for blessings 
[Page 171, Line 49] on him, and greet him with a prayer of peace.  
[Page 171, Line 50] 57. Those who insult Allah and His Messen-
[Page 171, Line 51] ger, Allah has cursed them in this life and in 
[Page 171, Line 52] the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a 
[Page 171, Line 53] demeaning punishment.  
[Page 171, Line 54] 58. Those who harm believing men and believ-
[Page 171, Line 55] ing women, for acts they did not commit, 
[Page 171, Line 56] bear the burden of p erjury and a flagrant sin.  
[Page 171, Line 57] 59. O Prophet! Tell your wives, and your 
[Page 171, Line 58] daughters, and the women of the believers, to 
[Page 171, Line 59] lengthen their garments. That is more proper, so they will be recognized and not 
[Page 171, Line 60] harassed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 171, Line 61] 60. If the hypocri tes, and those with sickness 
[Page 171, Line 62] in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the City, do not desist, We will incite you against 
[Page 171, Line 63] them; then they will not be your neighbors 
[Page 171, Line 64] there except for a short while.  
[Page 171, Line 65] 61. They are cursed; wherever they are found, 
[Page 171, Line 66] they should be captured and killed outright.  
[Page 171, Line 67] 62. Such has been Allah’s precedent with those 
[Page 171, Line 68] who passed away before. You will find no 
[Page 171, Line 69] change in Allah’s system.  
[Page 171, Line 70] 63. The people ask you about the Hour. Say, 
[Page 171, Line 71] “The knowledge thereof rests with Allah. But 
[Page 171, Line 72] what do you know? Pe rhaps the hour is near.”  
[Page 171, Line 73] 64. Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has 
[Page 171, Line 74] prepared for them a Blaze.  
[Page 171, Line 75] 65. Dwelling therein forever, not finding a 
[Page 171, Line 76] protector or a savior.  
[Page 171, Line 77] 66. The Day when their faces are flipped into 
[Page 171, Line 78] the Fire, they will say, “If only we had obeyed 
[Page 171, Line 79] Allah and obeyed the Messenger.”  
[Page 171, Line 80] 67. And they will say, “Lord, we have obeyed 
[Page 171, Line 81] our superiors and our dignitaries, but they 
[Page 171, Line 82] led us away from the way.  
[Page 171, Line 83] 68. Lord, give them double the punishment, 
[Page 171, Line 84] and curse them with a great curse.”  
[Page 171, Line 85] 69. O you who believe!  Do not be like those 
[Page 171, Line 86] who abused Moses; but Allah cleared him of 
[Page 171, Line 87] what they said. He was distinguished with Al-
[Page 171, Line 88] lah. 
[Page 171, Line 89] 160 
[Page 172, Line 1] 34.  SHEBA   (Saba’)  
[Page 172, Line 2] 70. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, 
[Page 172, Line 3] and speak in a straightforward manner.  
[Page 172, Line 4] 71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and 
[Page 172, Line 5] will forgi ve you your sins. Whoever obeys Al-
[Page 172, Line 6] lah and His Messenger has won a great vic-
[Page 172, Line 7] tory.  
[Page 172, Line 8] 72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and 
[Page 172, Line 9] the earth, and the mountains; but they re-
[Page 172, Line 10] fused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it; but the human being accepted it. He was un-
[Page 172, Line 11] fair and ignorant.  
[Page 172, Line 12] 73. Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and 
[Page 172, Line 13] women, and the idolaters, men and women. And Allah will redeem the believers, men and 
[Page 172, Line 14] women. Allah is Ever -Forgiving, Most Mer-
[Page 172, Line 15] ciful.  

[Page 172, Line 17] 34. SHEBA  
[Page 172, Line 18] (Saba’ ) 
[Page 172, Line 19] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 172, Line 20] the Gracious, th e Merciful  
[Page 172, Line 21] 1. Praise be to Allah, to Whom belongs every-
[Page 172, Line 22] thing in the heavens and the earth; and praise 
[Page 172, Line 23] be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the Wise, 
[Page 172, Line 24] the Expert.  
[Page 172, Line 25] 2. He knows what penetrates into the earth, 
[Page 172, Line 26] and what comes out of it, and what descends 
[Page 172, Line 27] from the s ky, and what ascends to it. He is the 
[Page 172, Line 28] Merciful, the Forgiving.  
[Page 172, Line 29] 3. Those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will 
[Page 172, Line 30] not come upon us.” Say, “Yes indeed, by my Lord, it will come upon you. He is the 
[Page 172, Line 31] Knower of the unseen.” Not an atom's weight 
[Page 172, Line 32] in the heavens and the earth, or anything 
[Page 172, Line 33] smaller or larger, escapes His knowledge. All are in a Clear Record.  
[Page 172, Line 34] 4. That He may recompense those who believe 
[Page 172, Line 35] and do good works. Those will have for-
[Page 172, Line 36] giveness, and a generous provision.  
[Page 172, Line 37] 5. As for those who strive against Our revela-
[Page 172, Line 38] tions , seeking to undermine them —for them 
[Page 172, Line 39] is a punishment of a painful plague.  
[Page 172, Line 40] 6. Those who received knowledge know that 
[Page 172, Line 41] what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth; and it guides to the path of the Majes-tic, the Praiseworthy.  
[Page 172, Line 42] 7. Those who disbelieved s aid, “Shall we point 
[Page 172, Line 43] out to you a man, who will tell you that, once 
[Page 172, Line 44] torn into shreds, you will be in a new crea-
[Page 172, Line 45] tion?  
[Page 172, Line 46] 8. Did he invent a lie about Allah, or is there 
[Page 172, Line 47] madness in him?” Indeed, those who do not 
[Page 172, Line 48] believe in the Hereafter are in torment, and 
[Page 172, Line 49] far astray.  
[Page 172, Line 50] 9. Do they not reflect upon what lies before 
[Page 172, Line 51] them and behind them, of the heaven and the 
[Page 172, Line 52] earth? If We will, We can make the earth cave in beneath them, or make pieces of the sky 
[Page 172, Line 53] fall down on them. In that is a sign for every 
[Page 172, Line 54] devout servant.  
[Page 172, Line 55] 10. We bestowed upon David favor from Us: 
[Page 172, Line 56] “O mountains, and birds: echo with him.” 
[Page 172, Line 57] And We softened iron for him.  
[Page 172, Line 58] 11. “Make coats of armor, and measure the 
[Page 172, Line 59] links well; and work righteousness. I am Ob-
[Page 172, Line 60] servant of everything you do.”  
[Page 172, Line 61] 12. And for Solomon the wind —its o utward 
[Page 172, Line 62] journey was one month, and its return jour-
[Page 172, Line 63] ney was one month. And We made a spring of tar flow for him. And there were sprites 
[Page 172, Line 64] that worked under him, by the leave of his 
[Page 172, Line 65] Lord. But whoever of them swerved from Our command, We make him taste of the 
[Page 172, Line 66] punishment of the Inferno.  
[Page 172, Line 67] 13. They made for him whatever he wished: 
[Page 172, Line 68] sanctuaries, statues, bowls like pools, and heavy cauldrons. “O House of David, work 
[Page 172, Line 69] with appreciation,” but a few of My servants 
[Page 172, Line 70] are appreciative.  
[Page 172, Line 71] 14. Then, when We decreed death for him, 
[Page 172, Line 72] nothing indicated his death to them except an 
[Page 172, Line 73] earthworm eating at his staff. Then, when he 
[Page 172, Line 74] fell down, it became clear to the sprites that, 
[Page 172, Line 75] had they known the unseen, they would not 
[Page 172, Line 76] have remained in the demeaning torment.  
[Page 172, Line 77] 15. In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a 
[Page 172, Line 78] wonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the 
[Page 172, Line 79] left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give 
[Page 172, Line 80] thanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving 
[Page 172, Line 81] Lord.  
[Page 172, Line 82] 161 
[Page 173, Line 1] 34.  SHEBA   (Saba’)  
[Page 173, Line 2] 16. But they turned away, so We unleashed 
[Page 173, Line 3] against them the flood of the dam; and We 
[Page 173, Line 4] substituted their two gardens with two gar-
[Page 173, Line 5] dens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and mea-
[Page 173, Line 6] ger harvest.  
[Page 173, Line 7] 17. We thus penalized them for their ingrati-
[Page 173, Line 8] tude. Would We penalize any but the un-grateful?  
[Page 173, Line 9] 18. Between them and the towns We had 
[Page 173, Line 10] blessed, We placed prominent towns, and 
[Page 173, Line 11] We made the travel between them easy. 
[Page 173, Line 12] “Travel between them by night and day, in 
[Page 173, Line 13] safety.”  
[Page 173, Line 14] 19. But they said, “Our Lord, lengthen the dis-
[Page 173, Line 15] tances of our journeys.” They wronged them-
[Page 173, Line 16] selves; so We made them history, and We scattered them in every direction. In this are 
[Page 173, Line 17] lessons for every steadfast and appreciative 
[Page 173, Line 18] person.  
[Page 173, Line 19] 20. Satan was correct in his assessment of 
[Page 173, Line 20] them. They followed him, except for a group 
[Page 173, Line 21] of believers.  
[Page 173, Line 22] 21. He had no authority over them; except that 
[Page 173, Line 23] We willed to distinguish him who believes in the Hereaf ter, from him who is doubtful 
[Page 173, Line 24] about it. Your Lord is Guardian over all 
[Page 173, Line 25] things.  
[Page 173, Line 26] 22. Say, “Call upon those whom you claim be-
[Page 173, Line 27] sides Allah. They possess not an atom's 
[Page 173, Line 28] weight in the heavens or the earth, and they 
[Page 173, Line 29] possess no share of either, and He has no 
[Page 173, Line 30] backers  from among them.”  
[Page 173, Line 31] 23. Intercession with Him is of no value, ex-
[Page 173, Line 32] cept for someone He has permitted. Until, 
[Page 173, Line 33] when fear has subsided from their hearts, they will say, “What did your Lord say?” They 
[Page 173, Line 34] will say, “The truth, and He is the High, the 
[Page 173, Line 35] Great.”  
[Page 173, Line 36] 24. Say, “Who provides for you from the heav-
[Page 173, Line 37] ens and the earth?” Say, “Allah. And Either 
[Page 173, Line 38] you, or we, are rightly guided, or in evident 
[Page 173, Line 39] error.”  
[Page 173, Line 40] 25. Say, “You will not be asked about our mis-
[Page 173, Line 41] deeds, nor will we be asked about what you 
[Page 173, Line 42] do.” 26. Say, “Our Lord will bring us together; then 
[Page 173, Line 43] He will judge between us equitably. He is the 
[Page 173, Line 44] All-Knowing Judge.”  
[Page 173, Line 45] 27. Say, “Show me those you have attached to 
[Page 173, Line 46] Him as associates. No indeed! But He is Al-
[Page 173, Line 47] lah, the Powerful, the Wise.”  
[Page 173, Line 48] 28. We sent you only universally to all people, 
[Page 173, Line 49] a heral d and warner, but most people do not 
[Page 173, Line 50] know.  
[Page 173, Line 51] 29. And they say, “When is this promise due, 
[Page 173, Line 52] if you are truthful?”  
[Page 173, Line 53] 30. Say, “You are promised a Day, which you 
[Page 173, Line 54] cannot postpone by one hour, nor bring for-
[Page 173, Line 55] ward.”  
[Page 173, Line 56] 31. Those who disbelieve say, “We will never 
[Page 173, Line 57] believe in this Quran, nor in what came be-
[Page 173, Line 58] fore it.” If you could only see the wrongdoers, 
[Page 173, Line 59] captive before their Lord, throwing back alle-
[Page 173, Line 60] gations at one another. Those who were op-
[Page 173, Line 61] pressed will say to those who were arrogant, 
[Page 173, Line 62] “Were it not for you, we would have been be-
[Page 173, Line 63] lievers.”  
[Page 173, Line 64] 32. Those who were arrogant will say to those 
[Page 173, Line 65] who were oppressed, “Was it us who turned 
[Page 173, Line 66] you away from guidance when it came to 
[Page 173, Line 67] you? No indeed, you yourselves were sinful.”  
[Page 173, Line 68] 33. And those who were oppressed will say to 
[Page 173, Line 69] those who were arrogant, “It was your 
[Page 173, Line 70] scheming by night and day; as you instructed 
[Page 173, Line 71] us to reject Allah, and to set up rivals to Him.” 
[Page 173, Line 72] They will hide their remorse when they see 
[Page 173, Line 73] the retribution. We will put yokes around the 
[Page 173, Line 74] necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be 
[Page 173, Line 75] repaid for anything other than what they 
[Page 173, Line 76] used to do?  
[Page 173, Line 77] 34. We sent no warner to any town, without its 
[Page 173, Line 78] affluent saying, “We reject what you are sent 
[Page 173, Line 79] with.”  
[Page 173, Line 80] 35. And they say, “We have more wealth and 
[Page 173, Line 81] more children, and we will not be punished.”  
[Page 173, Line 82] 36. Say, “My Lord spreads out His  bounty to 
[Page 173, Line 83] whomever He wills, or restricts it; but most people do not know.”  
[Page 173, Line 84] 37. It is neither your wealth nor your children 
[Page 173, Line 85] that bring you closer to Us, but it is he who 
[Page 173, Line 86] 162 
[Page 174, Line 1] 35.  ORIGINATOR   (Fatir)  
[Page 174, Line 2] believes and does good deeds. These will have 
[Page 174, Line 3] a double reward for what they did; and they 
[Page 174, Line 4] will reside in the Chambers, in peace and se-
[Page 174, Line 5] curity.  
[Page 174, Line 6] 38. But those who work against Our revela-
[Page 174, Line 7] tions, seeking to undermine them —those will 
[Page 174, Line 8] be summoned to the punishment.  
[Page 174, Line 9] 39. Say, “My Lord extends the provision to 
[Page 174, Line 10] whomever He wills of His servants, or with-
[Page 174, Line 11] holds it. Anything you spend, He will replace 
[Page 174, Line 12] it. He is the Best of providers.”  
[Page 174, Line 13] 40. On the Day when He gathers them all to-
[Page 174, Line 14] gether, then say to the angels, “Was it you 
[Page 174, Line 15] these used to worship?”  
[Page 174, Line 16] 41. They will say, “Be You glorified; You are 
[Page 174, Line 17] our Master, not them. In fact, they used to 
[Page 174, Line 18] worship the jinn, and most of them had faith in them.”  
[Page 174, Line 19] 42. “Today, none of you has the power to 
[Page 174, Line 20] profit or harm the other.” And We will say to 
[Page 174, Line 21] those who did wrong, “Taste the agony of the 
[Page 174, Line 22] Fire which you used to deny.”  
[Page 174, Line 23] 43. And whe n Our enlightening Verses are re-
[Page 174, Line 24] cited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a 
[Page 174, Line 25] man who wants to divert you from what your ancestors used to worship.” And they say, 
[Page 174, Line 26] “This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And 
[Page 174, Line 27] when the Truth comes to them, the blas-phemers s ay of the Truth, “This is nothing 
[Page 174, Line 28] but plain magic.”  
[Page 174, Line 29] 44. But We gave them no book to study, and 
[Page 174, Line 30] We did not send them any warner before you.  
[Page 174, Line 31] 45. Those before them also denied the Truth, 
[Page 174, Line 32] yet they have not attained one -tenth of what 
[Page 174, Line 33] We had given them. They rej ected My mes-
[Page 174, Line 34] sengers, so how was My disapproval?  
[Page 174, Line 35] 46. Say, “I offer you a single advice: devote 
[Page 174, Line 36] yourselves to Allah, in pairs, or individually; 
[Page 174, Line 37] and reflect. There is no madness in your 
[Page 174, Line 38] friend. He is just a warner to you, before the 
[Page 174, Line 39] advent of a severe punishm ent.”  
[Page 174, Line 40] 47. Say, “Whatever compensation I have asked 
[Page 174, Line 41] of you, is yours. My compensation comes only from Allah, and He is Witness over all 
[Page 174, Line 42] things.”  48. Say, “My Lord projects the truth. He is the 
[Page 174, Line 43] Knower of the Unseen.”  
[Page 174, Line 44] 49. Say, “The Truth has come; while false hood 
[Page 174, Line 45] can neither originate, nor regenerate.”  
[Page 174, Line 46] 50. Say, “If I err, I err only to my own loss; but 
[Page 174, Line 47] if I am guided, it is by what my Lord inspires me. He is Hearing and Near.”  
[Page 174, Line 48] 51. If you could only see when they are terri-
[Page 174, Line 49] fied, and there is no escape, and they are 
[Page 174, Line 50] seized from a nearby place.  
[Page 174, Line 51] 52. And they say, “We have believed in it.” But 
[Page 174, Line 52] how can they attain it from a distant place?  
[Page 174, Line 53] 53. They have rejected it in the past, and made 
[Page 174, Line 54] allegations from a far -off place.  
[Page 174, Line 55] 54. A barrier will be placed between them and 
[Page 174, Line 56] what they desire, as was done formerly with 
[Page 174, Line 57] their counterparts. They were in disturbing 
[Page 174, Line 58] doubt.  

[Page 174, Line 60] 35. ORIGINATOR  
[Page 174, Line 61] (Fatir ) 
[Page 174, Line 62] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 174, Line 63] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 174, Line 64] 1. Praise be to Allah, Originator of the heavens 
[Page 174, Line 65] and the earth, Maker of the angels messen-
[Page 174, Line 66] gers with wings —double, triple, and quadru-
[Page 174, Line 67] ple. He adds to creation as He wills. Allah is 
[Page 174, Line 68] Able to do all things.  
[Page 174, Line 69] 2. Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for the peo-
[Page 174, Line 70] ple, none can withhold it. And if He with-
[Page 174, Line 71] holds it, none can release it thereafter. He is 
[Page 174, Line 72] the Ex alted in Power, Full of Wisdom.  
[Page 174, Line 73] 3. O people! Remember Allah’s blessings 
[Page 174, Line 74] upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah 
[Page 174, Line 75] who provides for you from the heaven and 
[Page 174, Line 76] the earth? There is no god but He. So how are 
[Page 174, Line 77] you misled?  
[Page 174, Line 78] 4. If they reject you, messengers befor e you 
[Page 174, Line 79] were also rejected. To Allah all matters are re-
[Page 174, Line 80] turned.  
[Page 174, Line 81] 5. O people! The promise of Allah is true; so 
[Page 174, Line 82] let not the lowly life seduce you, and let not 
[Page 174, Line 83] the Tempter tempt you away from Allah.  
[Page 174, Line 84] 163 
[Page 175, Line 1] 35.  ORIGINATOR   (Fatir)  
[Page 175, Line 2] 6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an 
[Page 175, Line 3] enemy. He only  invites his gang to be among 
[Page 175, Line 4] the inmates of the Inferno.  
[Page 175, Line 5] 7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh 
[Page 175, Line 6] punishment, but those who believe and do 
[Page 175, Line 7] righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a 
[Page 175, Line 8] great reward.  
[Page 175, Line 9] 8. What of him whose evil deed was made at-
[Page 175, Line 10] tractive to h im, and so he regards it as good? 
[Page 175, Line 11] Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and He 
[Page 175, Line 12] guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not 
[Page 175, Line 13] waste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah 
[Page 175, Line 14] knows exactly what they do.  
[Page 175, Line 15] 9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which ag-
[Page 175, Line 16] itate clouds, which We drive to a dead land, 
[Page 175, Line 17] and thereby revive the ground after it had 
[Page 175, Line 18] died. Likewise is the Resurrection.  
[Page 175, Line 19] 10. Whoever desires honor —all honor belongs 
[Page 175, Line 20] to Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure, 
[Page 175, Line 21] and He elevates righteous conduct. As for those who plot evil , a terrible punishment 
[Page 175, Line 22] awaits them, and the planning of these will 
[Page 175, Line 23] fail. 
[Page 175, Line 24] 11. Allah created you from dust, then from a 
[Page 175, Line 25] small drop; then He made you pairs. No fe-
[Page 175, Line 26] male conceives, or delivers, except with His 
[Page 175, Line 27] knowledge. No living thing advances in years, 
[Page 175, Line 28] or it s life is shortened, except it be in a Rec-
[Page 175, Line 29] ord. That is surely easy for Allah.  
[Page 175, Line 30] 12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, 
[Page 175, Line 31] sweet, good to drink, while the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat, 
[Page 175, Line 32] and extract jewelry which you wear.  And you 
[Page 175, Line 33] see the ships plowing through them, so that 
[Page 175, Line 34] you may seek of His bounty, so that you may give thanks.  
[Page 175, Line 35] 13. He merges the night into the day, and He 
[Page 175, Line 36] merges the day into the night; and He regu-
[Page 175, Line 37] lates the sun and the moon, each running for 
[Page 175, Line 38] a stated term.  Such is Allah, your Lord; His is 
[Page 175, Line 39] the sovereignty. As for those you call upon 
[Page 175, Line 40] besides Him, they do not possess a speck.  
[Page 175, Line 41] 14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your 
[Page 175, Line 42] prayer. And even if they heard, they would not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 175, Line 43] tion, they will reject your partnership. None 
[Page 175, Line 44] informs you like an Expert.  
[Page 175, Line 45] 15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in 
[Page 175, Line 46] need of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the 
[Page 175, Line 47] Praiseworthy.  
[Page 175, Line 48] 16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and 
[Page 175, Line 49] produce a new creation.  
[Page 175, Line 50] 17. And that would not be difficult for Allah.  
[Page 175, Line 51] 18. No burdened soul can carry the burden of 
[Page 175, Line 52] another. Even if one weighted down calls for 
[Page 175, Line 53] help with its burden, nothing can be lifted 
[Page 175, Line 54] from it, even if they were related. You are to 
[Page 175, Line 55] warn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and 
[Page 175, Line 56] perform the prayer. He who purifies himself 
[Page 175, Line 57] purifies himself for his own good. To Allah is 
[Page 175, Line 58] the ultimate return.  
[Page 175, Line 59] 19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.  
[Page 175, Line 60] 20. Nor are the darkness and the light.  
[Page 175, Line 61] 21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat.  
[Page 175, Line 62] 22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah 
[Page 175, Line 63] causes whomever He wills to hear, but you 
[Page 175, Line 64] cannot make those in the graves hear.  
[Page 175, Line 65] 23. You are only a warner.  
[Page 175, Line 66] 24. We sent you with the truth; a bearer of 
[Page 175, Line 67] good news, and a warner. There is no com-
[Page 175, Line 68] munity but a warner has pass ed through it.  
[Page 175, Line 69] 25. If they disbelieve you, those before them 
[Page 175, Line 70] also disbelieved. Their messengers came to 
[Page 175, Line 71] them with the clear proofs, with the Psalms, and with the Enlightening Scripture.  
[Page 175, Line 72] 26. Then I seized those who disbelieved —so 
[Page 175, Line 73] how was My rejection?  
[Page 175, Line 74] 27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down 
[Page 175, Line 75] water from the sky? With it We produce 
[Page 175, Line 76] fruits of various colors. And in the mountains 
[Page 175, Line 77] are streaks of white and red —varying in their 
[Page 175, Line 78] hue—and pitch -black.  
[Page 175, Line 79] 28. Likewise, human beings, animals, and live-
[Page 175, Line 80] stock come in vari ous colors. From among 
[Page 175, Line 81] His servants, the learned fear Allah. Allah is 
[Page 175, Line 82] Almighty, Oft- Forgiving.  
[Page 175, Line 83] 29. Those who recite the Book of Allah, and 
[Page 175, Line 84] perform the prayer, and spend of what We 
[Page 175, Line 85] 164 
[Page 176, Line 1] 36.  YA-SEEN   (Ya-Seen)  
[Page 176, Line 2] have provided for them, secretly and pub-
[Page 176, Line 3] licly, expect a trade that will not fail.  
[Page 176, Line 4] 30. He will pay them their dues in full, and will 
[Page 176, Line 5] increase them from His bounty. He is Forgiv-
[Page 176, Line 6] ing and Appreciative.  
[Page 176, Line 7] 31. What We inspired in you, of the Book, is 
[Page 176, Line 8] the truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah 
[Page 176, Line 9] is Well -Informed of His servants, All -Seeing . 
[Page 176, Line 10] 32. Then We passed the Book to those of Our 
[Page 176, Line 11] servants whom We chose. Some of them wrong their souls, and some follow a middle 
[Page 176, Line 12] course, and some are in the foremost in good 
[Page 176, Line 13] deeds by Allah’s leave; that is the greatest 
[Page 176, Line 14] blessing.  
[Page 176, Line 15] 33. The Gardens of Eden, whic h they will en-
[Page 176, Line 16] ter. They will be adorned therein with gold 
[Page 176, Line 17] bracelets and pearls, and their garments 
[Page 176, Line 18] therein will be of silk.  
[Page 176, Line 19] 34. And they will say, “Praise Allah, who has 
[Page 176, Line 20] lifted all sorrow from us. Our Lord is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative.  
[Page 176, Line 21] 35. He Who settled us in the Home of Perma-
[Page 176, Line 22] nence, by His grace, where boredom will not 
[Page 176, Line 23] touch us, and fatigue will not afflict us.”  
[Page 176, Line 24] 36. As for those who disbelieve, for them is the 
[Page 176, Line 25] Fire of Hell, wherein they will never be fin-ished off and die, nor will its punishment b e 
[Page 176, Line 26] lightened for them. Thus We will repay every 
[Page 176, Line 27] ingrate.  
[Page 176, Line 28] 37. And they will scream therein, “Our Lord, 
[Page 176, Line 29] let us out, and we will act righteously, differ-
[Page 176, Line 30] ently from the way we used to act.” Did We 
[Page 176, Line 31] not give you a life long enough, in which an-
[Page 176, Line 32] yone who wanted to un derstand would have 
[Page 176, Line 33] understood? And the warner did come to 
[Page 176, Line 34] you. So taste. The evildoers will have no 
[Page 176, Line 35] helper.  
[Page 176, Line 36] 38. Allah is the Knower of the future of the 
[Page 176, Line 37] heavens and the earth. He knows what the 
[Page 176, Line 38] hearts contain.  
[Page 176, Line 39] 39. It is He who made you successors on earth . 
[Page 176, Line 40] Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief will recoil 
[Page 176, Line 41] upon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers 
[Page 176, Line 42] adds only to their Lord's disfavor of them. The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to 
[Page 176, Line 43] their perdition.  
[Page 176, Line 44] 40. Say, “Have you considered those partners 
[Page 176, Line 45] of yours that you worship instead of Allah? 
[Page 176, Line 46] Show me what they have created on earth. Or 
[Page 176, Line 47] do they have any share in the heavens?” Or 
[Page 176, Line 48] have We given them a book whose clear 
[Page 176, Line 49] teachings they follow? In fact, the wrongdo-ers promise one another nothing but delu-
[Page 176, Line 50] sions.  
[Page 176, Line 51] 41. Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest 
[Page 176, Line 52] they fall apart. And were they to fall apart, there is none to hold them together except 
[Page 176, Line 53] He. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.  
[Page 176, Line 54] 42. And they swore by Allah with their solemn 
[Page 176, Line 55] oaths, that if a warner came to them, they 
[Page 176, Line 56] would be more guided than any other people. 
[Page 176, Line 57] Yet when a warner came to them, it only in-
[Page 176, Line 58] creased them in aversion.  
[Page 176, Line 59] 43. Priding themselves on earth, and scheming 
[Page 176, Line 60] evil. But evil scheming overwhelms none but 
[Page 176, Line 61] its authors. Do they expect anything but the 
[Page 176, Line 62] preced ent of the ancients? You will not find 
[Page 176, Line 63] any change in Allah’s practice, and you will not find any substitute to Allah’s practice.  
[Page 176, Line 64] 44. Have they not journeyed in the land and 
[Page 176, Line 65] observed the fate of those who preceded 
[Page 176, Line 66] them? They were superior to them in 
[Page 176, Line 67] strengt h. But nothing can defeat Allah in the 
[Page 176, Line 68] heavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omnisci-
[Page 176, Line 69] ent and Omnipotent.  
[Page 176, Line 70] 45. If Allah were to punish the people for what 
[Page 176, Line 71] they have earned, He would not leave a single 
[Page 176, Line 72] living creature on its surface. But He defers them until a stated time. Then, when their 
[Page 176, Line 73] time has arrived —Allah is Observant of His 
[Page 176, Line 74] creatures.  

[Page 176, Line 76] 36. YA- SEEN  
[Page 176, Line 77] (Ya-Seen ) 
[Page 176, Line 78] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 176, Line 79] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 176, Line 80] 1. Ya, Seen.  
[Page 176, Line 81] 2. By the Wise Quran.  
[Page 176, Line 82] 165 
[Page 177, Line 1] 36.  YA-SEEN   (Ya-Seen)  
[Page 177, Line 2] 3. You are one of the messengers.  
[Page 177, Line 3] 4. On a straight path.  
[Page 177, Line 4] 5. The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci-
[Page 177, Line 5] ful. 
[Page 177, Line 6] 6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not 
[Page 177, Line 7] warned, and so they are unaware.  
[Page 177, Line 8] 7. The Word was realized against most of 
[Page 177, Line 9] them, for they do not believe.  
[Page 177, Line 10] 8. We placed shackles around their necks, up 
[Page 177, Line 11] to their chins, so they are stiff -necked.  
[Page 177, Line 12] 9. And We placed a barrier in front of them, 
[Page 177, Line 13] and a barrier behind them, and We have en-
[Page 177, Line 14] shrouded them, so they cannot see.  
[Page 177, Line 15] 10. It is the same for them, whether you warn 
[Page 177, Line 16] them, or do not warn them —they will not be-
[Page 177, Line 17] lieve.  
[Page 177, Line 18] 11. You warn only  him who follows the Mes-
[Page 177, Line 19] sage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly. 
[Page 177, Line 20] So give him good news of forgiveness, and a 
[Page 177, Line 21] generous reward.  
[Page 177, Line 22] 12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write 
[Page 177, Line 23] down what they have forwarded, and their 
[Page 177, Line 24] traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear 
[Page 177, Line 25] Record.  
[Page 177, Line 26] 13. And cite for them the parable of the land-
[Page 177, Line 27] lords of the town —when the messengers 
[Page 177, Line 28] came to it.  
[Page 177, Line 29] 14. We sent them two messengers, but they de-
[Page 177, Line 30] nied them both, so We reinforced them with 
[Page 177, Line 31] a third. They said, “We are messengers to 
[Page 177, Line 32] you.”  
[Page 177, Line 33] 15. They sa id, “You are nothing but humans 
[Page 177, Line 34] like us, and the Gracious did not send down anything; you are only lying.”  
[Page 177, Line 35] 16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are 
[Page 177, Line 36] messengers to you.  
[Page 177, Line 37] 17. And our only duty is clear communica-
[Page 177, Line 38] tion.”  
[Page 177, Line 39] 18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if 
[Page 177, Line 40] you do not give up, we will stone you, and a 
[Page 177, Line 41] painful punishment from us will befall you.”  19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is 
[Page 177, Line 42] it because you were reminded? But you are an 
[Page 177, Line 43] extravagant people.”  
[Page 177, Line 44] 20. Then a man came running from the remot-
[Page 177, Line 45] est part of the city. He said, “O my people, 
[Page 177, Line 46] follow the messengers.  
[Page 177, Line 47] 21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and 
[Page 177, Line 48] are themselves guided.  
[Page 177, Line 49] 22. “And why should I not worship Him Who 
[Page 177, Line 50] created me, and to Whom you will be re-
[Page 177, Line 51] turned?  
[Page 177, Line 52] 23. Shall I take other gods instead  of Him? If 
[Page 177, Line 53] the Merciful desires harm for me, their inter-
[Page 177, Line 54] cession will not avail me at all, nor will they 
[Page 177, Line 55] save me.  
[Page 177, Line 56] 24. In that case, I would be completely lost.  
[Page 177, Line 57] 25. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to 
[Page 177, Line 58] me.”  
[Page 177, Line 59] 26. It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said,  “If 
[Page 177, Line 60] only my people knew.  
[Page 177, Line 61] 27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made 
[Page 177, Line 62] me one of the honored.”  
[Page 177, Line 63] 28. After him, We sent down no hosts from 
[Page 177, Line 64] heaven to his people; nor would We ever send any down.  
[Page 177, Line 65] 29. It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.  
[Page 177, Line 66] 30. Alas for the se rvants. No messenger ever 
[Page 177, Line 67] came to them, but they ridiculed him.  
[Page 177, Line 68] 31. Have they not considered how many gen-
[Page 177, Line 69] erations We destroyed before them; and that unto them they will not return?  
[Page 177, Line 70] 32. All of them, every single one of them, will 
[Page 177, Line 71] be arraigned before Us.  
[Page 177, Line 72] 33. And there is a sign for them in the dead 
[Page 177, Line 73] land: We give it life, and produce from it grains from which they eat.  
[Page 177, Line 74] 34. And We place in it gardens of palm -trees 
[Page 177, Line 75] and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.  
[Page 177, Line 76] 35. That they may eat from its fruits, although  
[Page 177, Line 77] their hands did not make it. Will they not be appreciative?  
[Page 177, Line 78] 166 
[Page 178, Line 1] 36.  YA-SEEN   (Ya-Seen)  
[Page 178, Line 2] 36. Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; 
[Page 178, Line 3] of what the earth produces, and of their own 
[Page 178, Line 4] selves, and of what they do not know.  
[Page 178, Line 5] 37. Another sign for them is the night: We 
[Page 178, Line 6] strip the day out of i t—and they are in dark-
[Page 178, Line 7] ness.  
[Page 178, Line 8] 38. And the sun runs towards its destination. 
[Page 178, Line 9] Such is the design of the Almighty, the All -
[Page 178, Line 10] Knowing.  
[Page 178, Line 11] 39. And the moon: We have disposed it in 
[Page 178, Line 12] phases, until it returns like the old twig.  
[Page 178, Line 13] 40. The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor  is 
[Page 178, Line 14] the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an 
[Page 178, Line 15] orbit.  
[Page 178, Line 16] 41. Another sign for them is that We carried 
[Page 178, Line 17] their offspring in the laden Ark.  
[Page 178, Line 18] 42. And We created for them the like of it, in 
[Page 178, Line 19] which they ride.  
[Page 178, Line 20] 43. If We will, We can drown them —with no 
[Page 178, Line 21] screaming to  be heard from them, nor will 
[Page 178, Line 22] they be saved.  
[Page 178, Line 23] 44. Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment 
[Page 178, Line 24] for a while.  
[Page 178, Line 25] 45. Yet when it is said to them, “Beware of 
[Page 178, Line 26] what lies before you, and what lies behind you, that you may receive mercy.”  
[Page 178, Line 27] 46. Yet never came to them a sig n of their 
[Page 178, Line 28] Lord’s signs, but they turned away from it.  
[Page 178, Line 29] 47. And when it is said to them, “Spend of 
[Page 178, Line 30] what Allah has provided for you,” those who 
[Page 178, Line 31] disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we 
[Page 178, Line 32] feed someone whom Allah could feed, if He 
[Page 178, Line 33] so willed? You must be de eply misguided.”  
[Page 178, Line 34] 48. And they say, “When will this promise be, 
[Page 178, Line 35] if you are truthful?”  
[Page 178, Line 36] 49. All they can expect is a single blast, which 
[Page 178, Line 37] will seize them while they feud.  
[Page 178, Line 38] 50. They will not be able to make a will, nor 
[Page 178, Line 39] will they return to their families.  
[Page 178, Line 40] 51. The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, 
[Page 178, Line 41] they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.  
[Page 178, Line 42] 52. They will say, “Woe to us! Who resurrected 
[Page 178, Line 43] us from our resting -place?” This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the mes-
[Page 178, Line 44] sengers have spoken the truth.”  
[Page 178, Line 45] 53. It will  be but a single scream; and behold, 
[Page 178, Line 46] they will all be brought before Us.  
[Page 178, Line 47] 54. On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the 
[Page 178, Line 48] least, and you will be recompensed only for 
[Page 178, Line 49] what you used to do.  
[Page 178, Line 50] 55. The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day, 
[Page 178, Line 51] will be happily busy.  
[Page 178, Line 52] 56. They and their spouses, in shades, reclin-
[Page 178, Line 53] ing on couches.  
[Page 178, Line 54] 57. They will have therein fruits. They will 
[Page 178, Line 55] have whatever they call for.  
[Page 178, Line 56] 58. Peace— a saying from a Most Merciful 
[Page 178, Line 57] Lord.  
[Page 178, Line 58] 59. But step aside today, you criminals.  
[Page 178, Line 59] 60. Did I not covenant with you, O C hildren of 
[Page 178, Line 60] Adam, that you shall not serve the devil? That he is your sworn enemy?  
[Page 178, Line 61] 61. And that you shall serve Me? This is a 
[Page 178, Line 62] straight path.  
[Page 178, Line 63] 62. He has misled a great multitude of you. Did 
[Page 178, Line 64] you not understand?  
[Page 178, Line 65] 63. This is Hellfire, which you were promised.  
[Page 178, Line 66] 64. Roast in it today, because you persistently 
[Page 178, Line 67] disbelieved.  
[Page 178, Line 68] 65. On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and 
[Page 178, Line 69] their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to everything they had done.  
[Page 178, Line 70] 66. If We will, We can blind their eyes as they 
[Page 178, Line 71] rush towards the path —but how will they 
[Page 178, Line 72] see? 
[Page 178, Line 73] 67. And if We will, We can cripple them in 
[Page 178, Line 74] their place; so they can neither move forward, 
[Page 178, Line 75] nor go back.  
[Page 178, Line 76] 68. Whomever We grant old age, We reverse 
[Page 178, Line 77] his development. Do they not understand?  
[Page 178, Line 78] 69. We did not teach him poetry, nor is it 
[Page 178, Line 79] proper for him. It is only a reminder, and a Clear Quran.  
[Page 178, Line 80] 70. That he may warn whoever is alive, and 
[Page 178, Line 81] prove the Word against the faithless.  
[Page 178, Line 82] 167 
[Page 179, Line 1] 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
[Page 179, Line 2] 71. Have they not seen that We created for 
[Page 179, Line 3] them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they 
[Page 179, Line 4] own?  
[Page 179, Line 5] 72. And We subdued them for them. Some 
[Page 179, Line 6] they ride, and some they eat.  
[Page 179, Line 7] 73. And they have in them other benefits, and 
[Page 179, Line 8] drinks. Will they not give thanks?  
[Page 179, Line 9] 74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods 
[Page 179, Line 10] other than Allah, that perhaps they may be 
[Page 179, Line 11] helped.  
[Page 179, Line 12] 75. They cannot help them, although they are 
[Page 179, Line 13] arrayed as troops for them.  
[Page 179, Line 14] 76. So let their words not sadden you. We 
[Page 179, Line 15] know what they conceal, and what they re-veal.  
[Page 179, Line 16] 77. Does the human being not consider that 
[Page 179, Line 17] We created him from a seed? Yet he becomes 
[Page 179, Line 18] a fierce adversary.  
[Page 179, Line 19] 78. And he produces arguments against Us, 
[Page 179, Line 20] and he forgets his own creation. He says, “Who will revive the bones when they have 
[Page 179, Line 21] decayed?”  
[Page 179, Line 22] 79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in-
[Page 179, Line 23] stance will revive them. He has knowledge of 
[Page 179, Line 24] every creation.”  
[Page 179, Line 25] 80. He who produced fuel for you from the 
[Page 179, Line 26] green trees, with which you kindle a fire.  
[Page 179, Line 27] 81. Is not He who created the heavens and the 
[Page 179, Line 28] earth able to create the like of them? Cer-
[Page 179, Line 29] tainly. He is the Supreme All -Knowing Crea-
[Page 179, Line 30] tor. 
[Page 179, Line 31] 82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to 
[Page 179, Line 32] say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.  
[Page 179, Line 33] 83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the 
[Page 179, Line 34] dominion of everything, and to Him you will be returned.  

[Page 179, Line 36] 37. THE ALIGNERS  
[Page 179, Line 37] (as-Saffat ) 
[Page 179, Line 38] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 179, Line 39] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 179, Line 40] 1. By the aligners aligning.  2. And the drivers driving.  
[Page 179, Line 41] 3. And the reciters of the Reminder.  
[Page 179, Line 42] 4. Your God is indeed One.  
[Page 179, Line 43] 5. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve-
[Page 179, Line 44] rything between them; and Lord of the Easts.  
[Page 179, Line 45] 6. We have adorned the lower heaven with the 
[Page 179, Line 46] beauty of the planets.  
[Page 179, Line 47] 7. And guarded it against every defiant devil.  
[Page 179, Line 48] 8. They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal 
[Page 179, Line 49] Elite, for they get bombarded from every side.  
[Page 179, Line 50] 9. Repelled —they will have a lingering tor-
[Page 179, Line 51] ment.  
[Page 179, Line 52] 10. Except for him who snatches a fragment—
[Page 179, Line 53] he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.  
[Page 179, Line 54] 11. Inquire of them,  “Are they more difficult to 
[Page 179, Line 55] create, or the others We created?” We created 
[Page 179, Line 56] them from sticky clay.  
[Page 179, Line 57] 12. But you wonder, and they ridicule.  
[Page 179, Line 58] 13. And when reminded, they pay no atten-
[Page 179, Line 59] tion.  
[Page 179, Line 60] 14. And when they see a sign, they ridicule.  
[Page 179, Line 61] 15. And they say, “This is nothing but plain 
[Page 179, Line 62] magic.  
[Page 179, Line 63] 16. When we have died and become dust and 
[Page 179, Line 64] bones, shall we be resurrected?  
[Page 179, Line 65] 17. And our ancestors of old?”  
[Page 179, Line 66] 18. Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally 
[Page 179, Line 67] subdued.”  
[Page 179, Line 68] 19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be 
[Page 179, Line 69] staring.  
[Page 179, Line 70] 20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day 
[Page 179, Line 71] of Judgment.”  
[Page 179, Line 72] 21. “This is the Day of Separation which you 
[Page 179, Line 73] used to deny.  
[Page 179, Line 74] 22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma-
[Page 179, Line 75] tes, and what they used to worship.  
[Page 179, Line 76] 23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to 
[Page 179, Line 77] Hell.  
[Page 179, Line 78] 24. And stop them . They are to be questioned.”  
[Page 179, Line 79] 25. What is the matter with you? Why do you 
[Page 179, Line 80] not help one another?  
[Page 179, Line 81] 168 
[Page 180, Line 1] 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
[Page 180, Line 2] 26. In fact, on that Day, they will be submis-
[Page 180, Line 3] sive.  
[Page 180, Line 4] 27. They will come to one another, question-
[Page 180, Line 5] ing one another.  
[Page 180, Line 6] 28. They will say, “You used to come at us 
[Page 180, Line 7] from the right.”  
[Page 180, Line 8] 29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be-
[Page 180, Line 9] lievers.  
[Page 180, Line 10] 30. We had no authority over you. You your-
[Page 180, Line 11] selves were rebellious people.  
[Page 180, Line 12] 31. The Word of our Lord has been realized 
[Page 180, Line 13] against us. We are tasting it.  
[Page 180, Line 14] 32. We seduced you. We were seducers.”  
[Page 180, Line 15] 33. On that Day, they will share in the punish-
[Page 180, Line 16] ment.  
[Page 180, Line 17] 34. Thus We deal with the sinners.  
[Page 180, Line 18] 35. When it was said to them, “There is no god 
[Page 180, Line 19] except Allah,” they grew arrogant.  
[Page 180, Line 20] 36. And said, “Are we to abandon our gods for 
[Page 180, Line 21] a mad poet?”  
[Page 180, Line 22] 37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con-
[Page 180, Line 23] firmed the messengers.  
[Page 180, Line 24] 38. Most assuredly, you will taste the painful 
[Page 180, Line 25] punishment.  
[Page 180, Line 26] 39. And you will be repaid only for what you 
[Page 180, Line 27] used to do.  
[Page 180, Line 28] 40. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.  
[Page 180, Line 29] 41. For them is a known provision.  
[Page 180, Line 30] 42. Fruits; and they wi ll be honored.  
[Page 180, Line 31] 43. In the Gardens of Bliss.  
[Page 180, Line 32] 44. On furnishings, facing one another.  
[Page 180, Line 33] 45. They will be offered a cup of pure drink.  
[Page 180, Line 34] 46. White; a delight to those who drink.  
[Page 180, Line 35] 47. Never polluted, and never intoxicating.  
[Page 180, Line 36] 48. With them will be bashful women with 
[Page 180, Line 37] lovely eyes.  
[Page 180, Line 38] 49. As if they were closely guarded pearls.  
[Page 180, Line 39] 50. Then they will approach one another, 
[Page 180, Line 40] questioning.  51. One of them will say, “I used to have a 
[Page 180, Line 41] friend.  
[Page 180, Line 42] 52. Who used to say, “Are you of those who 
[Page 180, Line 43] believe?  
[Page 180, Line 44] 53. That after we die and become dust and  
[Page 180, Line 45] bones, we will be called to account?”  
[Page 180, Line 46] 54. He will say, “Will you have a look?”  
[Page 180, Line 47] 55. He will look, and will see him in the pit of 
[Page 180, Line 48] Hell.  
[Page 180, Line 49] 56. He will say, “By Allah, you almost ruined 
[Page 180, Line 50] me. 
[Page 180, Line 51] 57. Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I 
[Page 180, Line 52] would have been among the arraigned.”  
[Page 180, Line 53] 58. “We will not die.  
[Page 180, Line 54] 59. Except for our first death, and we will not 
[Page 180, Line 55] be punished.”  
[Page 180, Line 56] 60. This is the supreme triumph.  
[Page 180, Line 57] 61. For the like of this let the workers work.  
[Page 180, Line 58] 62. Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of 
[Page 180, Line 59] Bitterness?  
[Page 180, Line 60] 63. We made it an ordeal for the unjust.  
[Page 180, Line 61] 64. It is a tree that grows from the bottom of 
[Page 180, Line 62] Hell.  
[Page 180, Line 63] 65. Its fruits are like the devils’ heads.  
[Page 180, Line 64] 66. They will eat from it, and fill their bellies 
[Page 180, Line 65] with it.  
[Page 180, Line 66] 67. Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of 
[Page 180, Line 67] boiling liquid.  
[Page 180, Line 68] 68. Then their return will be to the Blaze.  
[Page 180, Line 69] 69. They had found their parents astray.  
[Page 180, Line 70] 70. And rushed along in their footsteps.  
[Page 180, Line 71] 71. And most of the ancients before them went 
[Page 180, Line 72] astray.  
[Page 180, Line 73] 72. Even though We sent messengers to warn 
[Page 180, Line 74] them.  
[Page 180, Line 75] 73. So observe the end of those who were  
[Page 180, Line 76] warned.  
[Page 180, Line 77] 74. Except for the sincere servants of Allah.  
[Page 180, Line 78] 75. And Noah called out to Us, and We are the 
[Page 180, Line 79] Best of responders.  
[Page 180, Line 80] 169 
[Page 181, Line 1] 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
[Page 181, Line 2] 76. And We saved him and his family from the 
[Page 181, Line 3] great calamity.  
[Page 181, Line 4] 77. And We made his descendants the survi-
[Page 181, Line 5] vors.  
[Page 181, Line 6] 78. And We left mention of him among those 
[Page 181, Line 7] who succeeded.  
[Page 181, Line 8] 79. Peace be upon Noah among all people.  
[Page 181, Line 9] 80. We thus reward the righteous.  
[Page 181, Line 10] 81. He was one of Our believing servants.  
[Page 181, Line 11] 82. Then We drowned the others.  
[Page 181, Line 12] 83. Of his kind was Abraham.  
[Page 181, Line 13] 84. When he came to his Lord with a sound 
[Page 181, Line 14] heart . 
[Page 181, Line 15] 85. He said to his father and his people, “What 
[Page 181, Line 16] are you worshiping?  
[Page 181, Line 17] 86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you 
[Page 181, Line 18] want?  
[Page 181, Line 19] 87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of 
[Page 181, Line 20] the Worlds?”  
[Page 181, Line 21] 88. Then he took a glance at the stars.  
[Page 181, Line 22] 89. And said, “I am sick.”  
[Page 181, Line 23] 90. But they turned their backs on him, and 
[Page 181, Line 24] went away.  
[Page 181, Line 25] 91. Then he turned to their gods, and said, 
[Page 181, Line 26] “will you not eat?  
[Page 181, Line 27] 92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”  
[Page 181, Line 28] 93. Then he turned on them, striking with his 
[Page 181, Line 29] right hand.  
[Page 181, Line 30] 94. And they came running towards him.  
[Page 181, Line 31] 95. He said, “Do you worship what you carve?  
[Page 181, Line 32] 96. When Allah created you, and what you 
[Page 181, Line 33] manufacture?”  
[Page 181, Line 34] 97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw 
[Page 181, Line 35] him into the furnace.”  
[Page 181, Line 36] 98. They wished him ill, but We made them 
[Page 181, Line 37] the losers.  
[Page 181, Line 38] 99.  He said, “I am g oing towards my Lord, and 
[Page 181, Line 39] He will guide me.”  
[Page 181, Line 40] 100. “My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”  101. So We gave him good news of a clement 
[Page 181, Line 41] boy.  
[Page 181, Line 42] 102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
[Page 181, Line 43] pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a 
[Page 181, Line 44] dream that I am sacrificing you; s ee what you 
[Page 181, Line 45] think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are 
[Page 181, Line 46] commanded; you will find me, Allah willing, 
[Page 181, Line 47] one of the steadfast.”  
[Page 181, Line 48] 103. Then, when they had submitted, and he 
[Page 181, Line 49] put his forehead down.  
[Page 181, Line 50] 104. We called out to him, “O Abraham!  
[Page 181, Line 51] 105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re-
[Page 181, Line 52] ward the doers of good.  
[Page 181, Line 53] 106. This was certainly an evident test.  
[Page 181, Line 54] 107. And We redeemed him with a great sacri-
[Page 181, Line 55] fice. 
[Page 181, Line 56] 108. And We left with him for later genera-
[Page 181, Line 57] tions.  
[Page 181, Line 58] 109. Peace be upon Abraham.  
[Page 181, Line 59] 110. Thus We reward the doers of good.  
[Page 181, Line 60] 111. He was one of Our believing servants.  
[Page 181, Line 61] 112. And We gave him good news of Isaac, a 
[Page 181, Line 62] prophet, one of the righteous.  
[Page 181, Line 63] 113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But 
[Page 181, Line 64] among their descendants are some who are 
[Page 181, Line 65] righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to 
[Page 181, Line 66] themselves.  
[Page 181, Line 67] 114. And We blessed Moses and Aaron.  
[Page 181, Line 68] 115. And We delivered them and their people 
[Page 181, Line 69] from the terrible disaster.  
[Page 181, Line 70] 116. And We supported them, and so they were 
[Page 181, Line 71] the victors.  
[Page 181, Line 72] 117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
[Page 181, Line 73] ture.  
[Page 181, Line 74] 118. And We guided them upon the straight 
[Page 181, Line 75] path.  
[Page 181, Line 76] 119. And We left with them for later genera-
[Page 181, Line 77] tions.  
[Page 181, Line 78] 120. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.  
[Page 181, Line 79] 121. Thus We reward the righteous.  
[Page 181, Line 80] 122. They were of Our believing servants.  
[Page 181, Line 81] 170 
[Page 182, Line 1] 37.  THE ALIGNERS   (as-Saffat)  
[Page 182, Line 2] 123. Also Elijah was one of the messengers.  
[Page 182, Line 3] 124. He said to his people, “Do you not fear?  
[Page 182, Line 4] 125. Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best 
[Page 182, Line 5] of creators?  
[Page 182, Line 6] 126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your 
[Page 182, Line 7] ancestors.”  
[Page 182, Line 8] 127. But they called him a liar, and thus they 
[Page 182, Line 9] will be brought forward.  
[Page 182, Line 10] 128. Except for Allah’s sincere servants.  
[Page 182, Line 11] 129. And We left with him for later genera-
[Page 182, Line 12] tions.  
[Page 182, Line 13] 130. Peace be upon the House of Elijah.  
[Page 182, Line 14] 131. Thus We reward the virtuous.  
[Page 182, Line 15] 132. He was one of Our believing servants.  
[Page 182, Line 16] 133. And Lot was one of the messengers.  
[Page 182, Line 17] 134. We saved him and his family, all of them.  
[Page 182, Line 18] 135. Except for an old woma n who lagged be-
[Page 182, Line 19] hind.  
[Page 182, Line 20] 136. Then We annihilated the others.  
[Page 182, Line 21] 137. You pass by them in the morning.  
[Page 182, Line 22] 138. And at night. Do you not understand?  
[Page 182, Line 23] 139. And Jonah was one of the messengers.  
[Page 182, Line 24] 140. When he fled to the laden boat.  
[Page 182, Line 25] 141. He gambled and lost.  
[Page 182, Line 26] 142. Then the  fish swallowed him, and he was 
[Page 182, Line 27] to blame.  
[Page 182, Line 28] 143. Had he not been one of those who praised.  
[Page 182, Line 29] 144. He would have stayed in its belly until the 
[Page 182, Line 30] Day they are raised.  
[Page 182, Line 31] 145. Then We threw him into the wilderness, 
[Page 182, Line 32] and he was sick.  
[Page 182, Line 33] 146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.  
[Page 182, Line 34] 147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand, 
[Page 182, Line 35] or more.  
[Page 182, Line 36] 148. And they believed, so We gave them en-
[Page 182, Line 37] joyment for a while.  
[Page 182, Line 38] 149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your 
[Page 182, Line 39] Lord, while for them the sons?”  150. Or did We create the angels females, as 
[Page 182, Line 40] they witn essed?”  
[Page 182, Line 41] 151. No indeed! It is one of their lies when they 
[Page 182, Line 42] say. 
[Page 182, Line 43] 152. “Allah has begotten.” They are indeed ly-
[Page 182, Line 44] ing. 
[Page 182, Line 45] 153. So He preferred girls over boys?  
[Page 182, Line 46] 154. What is the matter with you? How do you 
[Page 182, Line 47] judge?  
[Page 182, Line 48] 155. Will you not reflect?  
[Page 182, Line 49] 156. Or do you have some c lear proof?  
[Page 182, Line 50] 157. Then bring your book, if you are telling 
[Page 182, Line 51] the truth.  
[Page 182, Line 52] 158. And they invented a relationship between 
[Page 182, Line 53] Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they 
[Page 182, Line 54] will be arraigned.  
[Page 182, Line 55] 159. Allah be glorified, far above what they al-
[Page 182, Line 56] lege.  
[Page 182, Line 57] 160. Except for Allah’s  sincere servants.  
[Page 182, Line 58] 161. Surely, you and what you serve.  
[Page 182, Line 59] 162. Cannot seduce away from Him.  
[Page 182, Line 60] 163. Except for he who will be roasting in Hell.  
[Page 182, Line 61] 164. “There is not one of us but has an assigned 
[Page 182, Line 62] position.  
[Page 182, Line 63] 165. And we are the arrangers.  
[Page 182, Line 64] 166. And we are the glorifiers.”  
[Page 182, Line 65] 167. Even though they used to say.  
[Page 182, Line 66] 168. “Had we received advice from the an-
[Page 182, Line 67] cients.  
[Page 182, Line 68] 169. We would have been Allah's faithful serv-
[Page 182, Line 69] ants.”  
[Page 182, Line 70] 170. But they rejected it, so they will find out.  
[Page 182, Line 71] 171. Our Word has already gone out to our 
[Page 182, Line 72] servant messenge rs. 
[Page 182, Line 73] 172. It is they who will be supported.  
[Page 182, Line 74] 173. And Our troops will be the victors.  
[Page 182, Line 75] 174. So disregard them for a while.  
[Page 182, Line 76] 175. And watch them —they will soon see.  
[Page 182, Line 77] 176. Are they seeking to hasten Our punish-
[Page 182, Line 78] ment?  
[Page 182, Line 79] 171 
[Page 183, Line 1] 38.  SAAD   (Saad)  
[Page 183, Line 2] 177. When it descends into their yard, misera-
[Page 183, Line 3] ble will be the morning of those forewarned.  
[Page 183, Line 4] 178. So avoid them for a while.  
[Page 183, Line 5] 179. And watch —they will soon see.  
[Page 183, Line 6] 180. Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, 
[Page 183, Line 7] beyond their allegations.  
[Page 183, Line 8] 181. And peace be upon the messengers.  
[Page 183, Line 9] 182. And praise be to Allah, the Lor d of the 
[Page 183, Line 10] Worlds.  

[Page 183, Line 12] 38. SAAD 
[Page 183, Line 13] (Saad ) 
[Page 183, Line 14] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 183, Line 15] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 183, Line 16] 1. Saad. By the renowned Quran.  
[Page 183, Line 17] 2. Those who disbelieve are steeped in arro-
[Page 183, Line 18] gance and defiance.  
[Page 183, Line 19] 3. How many generations have We destroyed 
[Page 183, Line 20] before them? They cried out when it was too 
[Page 183, Line 21] late to escape.  
[Page 183, Line 22] 4. And they marveled that a warner has come 
[Page 183, Line 23] to them from among them. The disbelievers 
[Page 183, Line 24] said, “This is a lying magician.”  
[Page 183, Line 25] 5. “Did he turn all the gods into one God? This 
[Page 183, Line 26] is something strange.”  
[Page 183, Line 27] 6. The notables among them announced: “G o 
[Page 183, Line 28] on, and hold fast to your gods. This is some-thing planned.  
[Page 183, Line 29] 7. We never heard of this in the former faith. 
[Page 183, Line 30] This is nothing but a fabrication.  
[Page 183, Line 31] 8. Was the message sent down to him, out of 
[Page 183, Line 32] all of us?” In fact, they are doubtful of My 
[Page 183, Line 33] warning. In fact, they h ave not yet tasted My 
[Page 183, Line 34] punishment.  
[Page 183, Line 35] 9. Or do they possess the treasuries of the 
[Page 183, Line 36] mercy of your Lord —the Majestic, the Giver?  
[Page 183, Line 37] 10. Or do they possess the sovereignty of the 
[Page 183, Line 38] heavens and the earth and what is between 
[Page 183, Line 39] them? Then let them ascend the ropes.  
[Page 183, Line 40] 11. An army of confederates will be defeated 
[Page 183, Line 41] there.  12. Before them the people of Noah denied the 
[Page 183, Line 42] truth; as did Aad, and Pharaoh of the Stakes.  
[Page 183, Line 43] 13. And Thamood, and the people of Lot, and 
[Page 183, Line 44] the dwellers of the Woods —these were the 
[Page 183, Line 45] confederates.  
[Page 183, Line 46] 14. None of them but denied the messengers, 
[Page 183, Line 47] so My retribution was deserved.  
[Page 183, Line 48] 15. These can expect only a single scream, 
[Page 183, Line 49] from which there is no recovery.  
[Page 183, Line 50] 16. And they say, “Our Lord, hasten Your writ 
[Page 183, Line 51] upon us, before the Day of Account.”  
[Page 183, Line 52] 17. Be patient in the face of what they say, and 
[Page 183, Line 53] mention Our servant David, the resourceful. He was obedient.  
[Page 183, Line 54] 18. We committed the mountains to glorify 
[Page 183, Line 55] with him, in the evening and at daybreak.  
[Page 183, Line 56] 19. And the birds, gathered together. All obe-
[Page 183, Line 57] dient to him.  
[Page 183, Line 58] 20. And We strengthened his kingdom, and 
[Page 183, Line 59] gave him wisdom and decisive speech.  
[Page 183, Line 60] 21. Has the story of the two disputants reached 
[Page 183, Line 61] you? When they scaled the sanctuary?  
[Page 183, Line 62] 22. When they entered upon David, and he 
[Page 183, Line 63] was startled by them. They said, “Do not fear. 
[Page 183, Line 64] Two disputants; one of us has wronged the 
[Page 183, Line 65] other ; so judge between us fairly, and do not 
[Page 183, Line 66] be biased, and guide us to the straight way.”  
[Page 183, Line 67] 23. “This brother of mine has ninety nine 
[Page 183, Line 68] ewes, and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘En-trust it to me,’ and he pressured me with 
[Page 183, Line 69] words.”  
[Page 183, Line 70] 24. He said, “He has done you wrong  by asking 
[Page 183, Line 71] your ewe in addition to his ewes. Many part-
[Page 183, Line 72] ners take advantage of one another, except those who believe and do good deeds, but 
[Page 183, Line 73] these are so few.” David realized that We 
[Page 183, Line 74] were testing him, so he sought forgiveness 
[Page 183, Line 75] from his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and 
[Page 183, Line 76] repented.  
[Page 183, Line 77] 25. So We forgave him that. And for him is 
[Page 183, Line 78] nearness to Us, and a good place of return.  
[Page 183, Line 79] 26. “O David, We made you a ruler in the land, 
[Page 183, Line 80] so judge between the people with justice, and 
[Page 183, Line 81] do not follow desire, lest it diverts you from 
[Page 183, Line 82] 172 
[Page 184, Line 1] 38.  SAAD   (Saad)  
[Page 184, Line 2] Allah ’s path. Those who stray from Allah’s 
[Page 184, Line 3] path will have a painful punishment, for hav-
[Page 184, Line 4] ing ignored the Day of Account.”  
[Page 184, Line 5] 27. We did not create the heaven and the earth 
[Page 184, Line 6] and everything between them in vain. That is 
[Page 184, Line 7] the assumption of those who disbelieve —so 
[Page 184, Line 8] woe to those who disbelieve because of the 
[Page 184, Line 9] Fire.  
[Page 184, Line 10] 28. Or are We to treat those who believe and 
[Page 184, Line 11] do righteous deeds like those who make trou-
[Page 184, Line 12] ble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like 
[Page 184, Line 13] the shameless?  
[Page 184, Line 14] 29. A blessed Book that We sent down to you, 
[Page 184, Line 15] that they may pond er its Verses, and for those 
[Page 184, Line 16] with intelligence to take heed.  
[Page 184, Line 17] 30. And We granted David, Solomon, an ex-
[Page 184, Line 18] cellent servant. He was penitent.  
[Page 184, Line 19] 31. When the beautiful horses were paraded 
[Page 184, Line 20] before him in the evening.  
[Page 184, Line 21] 32. He said, “I have preferred the love of nice-
[Page 184, Line 22] ties to the remembrance of my Lord —until it 
[Page 184, Line 23] disappeared behind the veil.  
[Page 184, Line 24] 33. Bring them back to me.” And he began ca-
[Page 184, Line 25] ressing their legs and necks.  
[Page 184, Line 26] 34. We tested Solomon, and placed a body on 
[Page 184, Line 27] his throne; then he repented.  
[Page 184, Line 28] 35. He said, “My Lord, forgive me, and grant 
[Page 184, Line 29] me a kingdom never to be attained by anyone after me. You are the Giver.”  
[Page 184, Line 30] 36. So We placed the wind at his service, blow-
[Page 184, Line 31] ing gently by his command, wherever he di-rected.  
[Page 184, Line 32] 37. And the demons —every builder and diver.  
[Page 184, Line 33] 38. And others fettered in chains.  
[Page 184, Line 34] 39. “This is Our gift; so give generously, or 
[Page 184, Line 35] withhold; without account.”  
[Page 184, Line 36] 40. For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful 
[Page 184, Line 37] resort.  
[Page 184, Line 38] 41. And mention Our servant Job, when he 
[Page 184, Line 39] called out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me 
[Page 184, Line 40] with hardship and pain.”  
[Page 184, Line 41] 42. “Stamp with your foot— here is cool water 
[Page 184, Line 42] to wash with, and to drink.”  43. And We restored his family for him, and 
[Page 184, Line 43] their like with them; as a mercy from Us, and 
[Page 184, Line 44] a lesson for those who possess insight.  
[Page 184, Line 45] 44. “Take with your hand a bundle, and strike 
[Page 184, Line 46] with it, and do not br eak your oath.” We 
[Page 184, Line 47] found him patient. What an excellent serv-ant! He was obedient.  
[Page 184, Line 48] 45. And mention Our servants Abraham, 
[Page 184, Line 49] Isaac, and Jacob —endowed with ability and 
[Page 184, Line 50] vision.  
[Page 184, Line 51] 46. We distinguished them with a distinct 
[Page 184, Line 52] quality: the remembrance of the Home.  
[Page 184, Line 53] 47. To Us they are among the chosen, the out-
[Page 184, Line 54] standing.  
[Page 184, Line 55] 48. And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel; 
[Page 184, Line 56] all are among the outstanding.  
[Page 184, Line 57] 49. This is a reminder. The devout will have a 
[Page 184, Line 58] good place of return.  
[Page 184, Line 59] 50. The Gardens of Eden, with their doors 
[Page 184, Line 60] wide -open for them.  
[Page 184, Line 61] 51. Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant 
[Page 184, Line 62] fruit and beverage.  
[Page 184, Line 63] 52. With them will be attendants with modest 
[Page 184, Line 64] gaze, of same age.  
[Page 184, Line 65] 53. This is what you are promised for the Day 
[Page 184, Line 66] of Account.  
[Page 184, Line 67] 54. Such is Our bounty, inexhaustible.  
[Page 184, Line 68] 55. All This. But the trans gressors will have a 
[Page 184, Line 69] miserable return.  
[Page 184, Line 70] 56. Hell; in which they will roast; what a mis-
[Page 184, Line 71] erable abode!  
[Page 184, Line 72] 57. All this. Let them taste it— boiling and bit-
[Page 184, Line 73] ter cold.  
[Page 184, Line 74] 58. And similar torments of diverse kinds.  
[Page 184, Line 75] 59. “This is a crowd rushing headlong with 
[Page 184, Line 76] you.” There is  no welcome for them. They 
[Page 184, Line 77] will be scorched by the Fire.  
[Page 184, Line 78] 60. They will say, “But it is you! There is no 
[Page 184, Line 79] welcome for you! It is you who brought it 
[Page 184, Line 80] upon us! What a miserable end!”  
[Page 184, Line 81] 61. They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought 
[Page 184, Line 82] this upon us, give him double to rment in the 
[Page 184, Line 83] Fire.”  
[Page 184, Line 84] 173 
[Page 185, Line 1] 39.  THRONGS   (az-Zumar)  
[Page 185, Line 2] 62. And they will say, “What is it with us that 
[Page 185, Line 3] we do not see men we used to count among 
[Page 185, Line 4] the wicked?  
[Page 185, Line 5] 63. Did we take them for mockery, or have our 
[Page 185, Line 6] eyes swerved from them?  
[Page 185, Line 7] 64. This is certainly true —the feuding of the 
[Page 185, Line 8] people of the Fire.  
[Page 185, Line 9] 65. Say, “I am only a warner, and there is no 
[Page 185, Line 10] god except Allah— the One, the Conqueror.  
[Page 185, Line 11] 66. The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and 
[Page 185, Line 12] everything between them; the Mighty, the 
[Page 185, Line 13] Forgiver.”  
[Page 185, Line 14] 67. Say, “It is a message of great importance.  
[Page 185, Line 15] 68. From which you are  turning away.  
[Page 185, Line 16] 69. I have no knowledge of the Highest Assem-
[Page 185, Line 17] bly as they dispute.  
[Page 185, Line 18] 70. It is only revealed to me that I am a clear 
[Page 185, Line 19] warner.”  
[Page 185, Line 20] 71. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating 
[Page 185, Line 21] a human being from clay.  
[Page 185, Line 22] 72. When I have formed him, and breathed 
[Page 185, Line 23] into him of My spirit, fall prostrate before 
[Page 185, Line 24] him.  
[Page 185, Line 25] 73. So the angels fell prostrate, all of them.  
[Page 185, Line 26] 74. Except for Satan. He was too proud, and 
[Page 185, Line 27] one of the faithless.  
[Page 185, Line 28] 75. He said, “O Satan, what prevented you 
[Page 185, Line 29] from prostrating before what I created with 
[Page 185, Line 30] My Own hand s? Are you too proud, or were 
[Page 185, Line 31] you one of the exalted?”  
[Page 185, Line 32] 76. He said, “I am better than he; You created 
[Page 185, Line 33] me from fire, and You created him from 
[Page 185, Line 34] clay.”  
[Page 185, Line 35] 77. He said, “Then get out of here! You are an 
[Page 185, Line 36] outcast!  
[Page 185, Line 37] 78. And My curse will be upon you until the 
[Page 185, Line 38] Day of J udgment.”  
[Page 185, Line 39] 79. He said, “Lord, defer me until the Day they 
[Page 185, Line 40] are resurrected.”  
[Page 185, Line 41] 80. He said, “You are one of those deferred.  
[Page 185, Line 42] 81. Until the Day of the Time Appointed.”  82. He said, “By Your majesty, I will seduce 
[Page 185, Line 43] them all.  
[Page 185, Line 44] 83. Except for your loyal servants amo ng 
[Page 185, Line 45] them.”  
[Page 185, Line 46] 84. He said, “The truth is, and I say the truth.  
[Page 185, Line 47] 85. I will fill Hell with you, and with every one 
[Page 185, Line 48] of them who follows you.”  
[Page 185, Line 49] 86. Say, “I ask of you no wage for this, and I am 
[Page 185, Line 50] not a pretender.  
[Page 185, Line 51] 87. It is but a reminder to mankind.  
[Page 185, Line 52] 88. And you will know its message after a 
[Page 185, Line 53] while.”

[Page 185, Line 57] In the name of Allah,

[Page 185, Line 59] 1. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the 
[Page 185, Line 60] Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 185, Line 61] 2. We sent down to you the Book with the 
[Page 185, Line 62] truth, so serve Allah, devoting your relig ion 
[Page 185, Line 63] to Him.  
[Page 185, Line 64] 3. Is not to Allah that sincere faith is due? As 
[Page 185, Line 65] for those who take guardians besides Him, 
[Page 185, Line 66] “We only worship them that they may bring 
[Page 185, Line 67] us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between 
[Page 185, Line 68] them regarding their differences. Allah does 
[Page 185, Line 69] not guide the lying blasphemer.  
[Page 185, Line 70] 4. If Allah wanted to have a son, He could have 
[Page 185, Line 71] selected from His creation at will. Glory be to 
[Page 185, Line 72] Him. He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing.  
[Page 185, Line 73] 5. He created the heavens and the earth with 
[Page 185, Line 74] reason. He wraps the night around the day, and He wraps the day around the night. And 
[Page 185, Line 75] He regulates the sun and the moon, each run-
[Page 185, Line 76] ning along a specific course. He is indeed the

[Page 186, Line 5] 7. If you disbelieve, Allah is Independent of 
[Page 186, Line 6] you, yet He does not approve ingratitude on 
[Page 186, Line 7] the part of His servants. And if you are thank-
[Page 186, Line 8] ful, He will approve that in you. No bearer of 
[Page 186, Line 9] burden can bear the burden of another. Then 
[Page 186, Line 10] to your Lord is your return; and He will in-

[Page 186, Line 12] of w hat the hearts contain.  
[Page 186, Line 13] 8. When some adversity touches the human 
[Page 186, Line 14] being, he prays to his Lord, repenting to Him. 
[Page 186, Line 15] But then, when He confers on him a grace of 
[Page 186, Line 16] His, he forgets what he was praying for be-
[Page 186, Line 17] fore, and he attributes rivals to Allah, in order 
[Page 186, Line 18] to lead astray from His way. Say, “Enjoy your 
[Page 186, Line 19] disbelief for a little while; you will be among 
[Page 186, Line 20] the inmates of the Fire.”  
[Page 186, Line 21] 9. Is he who worships devoutly during the 
[Page 186, Line 22] watches of the night, prostrating himself and 
[Page 186, Line 23] standing up, mindful of the Hereafter, and placing his h ope in the mercy of his Lord? 
[Page 186, Line 24] Say, “Are those who know and those who do not know equal?” Only those possessed of 
[Page 186, Line 25] reason will remember.  
[Page 186, Line 26] 10. Say, “O My devotees who have believed, 
[Page 186, Line 27] keep your duty to your Lord. For those who 
[Page 186, Line 28] do good in this world, is goodness.  And Al-
[Page 186, Line 29] lah’s earth is vast. The steadfast will be paid their wages in full, without reckoning.”  
[Page 186, Line 30] 11. Say, “I was commanded to serve Allah, de-
[Page 186, Line 31] voting my religion exclusively to Him.  
[Page 186, Line 32] 12. And I was commanded to be the first of 
[Page 186, Line 33] those who submit.”  
[Page 186, Line 34] 13. Say, “I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the 
[Page 186, Line 35] punishment of a horrendous Day.”  
[Page 186, Line 36] 14. Say, “It is Allah I worship, sincere in my 
[Page 186, Line 37] faith in Him.”  
[Page 186, Line 38] 15. “But you can worship whatever you wish 
[Page 186, Line 39] besides Him.” Say, “The losers are those who 
[Page 186, Line 40] lose their souls and their people on the D ay 
[Page 186, Line 41] of Resurrection.” That is indeed the obvious 
[Page 186, Line 42] loss.  16. They will have layers of Fire above them, 
[Page 186, Line 43] and layers beneath them. That is how Allah 
[Page 186, Line 44] strikes fear into His servants —“O My serv-
[Page 186, Line 45] ants! Beware of Me!”  
[Page 186, Line 46] 17. As for those who avoid the worship of 
[Page 186, Line 47] idols, and devote themselves to Allah— theirs 
[Page 186, Line 48] is the good news. So give good news to My 
[Page 186, Line 49] servants.  
[Page 186, Line 50] 18. Those who listen to the Word, and follow 
[Page 186, Line 51] the best of it. These are they whom Allah has 
[Page 186, Line 52] guided. These are they who possess intellect.  
[Page 186, Line 53] 19. What about someone who has deserved the 
[Page 186, Line 54] sentence of punishment? Is it you who can 
[Page 186, Line 55] save those in the Fire?  
[Page 186, Line 56] 20. But those who fear their Lord will have 
[Page 186, Line 57] mansions upon mansions, built high, with 
[Page 186, Line 58] streams flowing beneath them. The promise of Allah; and Allah never breaks a promise.  
[Page 186, Line 59] 21. Have you not considered how Allah sends 
[Page 186, Line 60] down water from the sky, then He makes it 
[Page 186, Line 61] flow into underground wells, then He pro-duces with it plants of various colors, then 
[Page 186, Line 62] they wither and you see them yellowing, then 
[Page 186, Line 63] He turns them into debris? Surely in this is a  
[Page 186, Line 64] reminder for those with understanding.  
[Page 186, Line 65] 22. What about someone whose heart Allah 
[Page 186, Line 66] has opened to Islam, so that he follows a light from His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the mention of Allah. Those are in manifest error.  
[Page 186, Line 67] 23. Allah has sent down the best of narrations: 
[Page 186, Line 68] a Scripture consistent and paired. The skins 
[Page 186, Line 69] of those who reverence their Lord shiver 
[Page 186, Line 70] from it, then their skins and their hearts sof-
[Page 186, Line 71] ten up to the remembrance of Allah. Such is 
[Page 186, Line 72] Allah’s guidance; He guides with it whom-
[Page 186, Line 73] ever H e wills. But whomever Allah leaves 
[Page 186, Line 74] astray, for him there is no guide.  
[Page 186, Line 75] 24. What about someone who covers his face 
[Page 186, Line 76] against the terrible misery of the Day of Res-urrection? To the evildoers it will be said, 
[Page 186, Line 77] “Taste what you used to earn.”  
[Page 186, Line 78] 25. Those before them also denied the truth, so 
[Page 186, Line 79] the penalty came upon them from where they 
[Page 186, Line 80] did not perceive.  
[Page 186, Line 81] 175 
[Page 187, Line 1] 39.  THRONGS   (az-Zumar)  
[Page 187, Line 2] 26. Allah made them taste disgrace in the pre-
[Page 187, Line 3] sent life, but the punishment of the Hereafter 
[Page 187, Line 4] is worse, if they only knew.  
[Page 187, Line 5] 27. We have cited in this Quran for mankind 
[Page 187, Line 6] every ideal, that they may take heed.  
[Page 187, Line 7] 28. An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so 
[Page 187, Line 8] they may become righteous.  
[Page 187, Line 9] 29. Allah cites the example of a man shared by 
[Page 187, Line 10] partners at odds, and a man belonging exclu-sively to one man. Are they equal in status? Praise be to All ah, but most of them do not 
[Page 187, Line 11] know.  
[Page 187, Line 12] 30. You will die, and they will die.  
[Page 187, Line 13] 31. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will 
[Page 187, Line 14] be quarrelling before your Lord.  
[Page 187, Line 15] 32. Who is more evil than he who lies about 
[Page 187, Line 16] Allah, and denies the truth when it has come 
[Page 187, Line 17] to him? Is there  not in Hell room for the un-
[Page 187, Line 18] grateful?  
[Page 187, Line 19] 33. But he who promotes the truth, and testi-
[Page 187, Line 20] fies to it —these are the righteous.  
[Page 187, Line 21] 34. They will have whatever they please with 
[Page 187, Line 22] their Lord. Such is the reward for the virtu-
[Page 187, Line 23] ous. 
[Page 187, Line 24] 35. Allah will acquit them of the worst of t heir 
[Page 187, Line 25] deeds, and will reward them according to the 
[Page 187, Line 26] best of what they used to do.  
[Page 187, Line 27] 36. Is Allah not enough for His servant? And 
[Page 187, Line 28] they frighten you with those besides Him. Whomever Allah sends astray, for him there 
[Page 187, Line 29] is no guide.  
[Page 187, Line 30] 37. And whomever Allah guides, for him there 
[Page 187, Line 31] is no misleader. Is Allah not Powerful and 
[Page 187, Line 32] Vengeful?  
[Page 187, Line 33] 38. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
[Page 187, Line 34] heavens and the earth?” they would say, “Al-
[Page 187, Line 35] lah.” Say, “Have you seen those you pray to instead of Allah? If Allah willed any harm for 
[Page 187, Line 36] me, can they lift His harm? And if He willed 
[Page 187, Line 37] a blessing for me, can they hold back His 
[Page 187, Line 38] mercy?” Say, “Allah suffices for me. On Him 
[Page 187, Line 39] the reliant rely.”  
[Page 187, Line 40] 39. Say: “O my people, work according to your 
[Page 187, Line 41] ability; and so will I. Then you will know.  40. Who will receive a humiliating punish-
[Page 187, Line 42] ment, and on whom will fall a lasting tor-ment.”  
[Page 187, Line 43] 41. We sent down upon you the Book for man-
[Page 187, Line 44] kind in truth. He who follows guidance does 
[Page 187, Line 45] so for the good of his soul. And he who strays 
[Page 187, Line 46] in error does so to its detriment. You are not 
[Page 187, Line 47] their overseer.  
[Page 187, Line 48] 42. Allah takes the souls at the time of their 
[Page 187, Line 49] death, and those that have not died during 
[Page 187, Line 50] their sleep. He retains those for which He has 
[Page 187, Line 51] decreed death, and He releases the others un-
[Page 187, Line 52] til a predetermined time. In that are signs for 
[Page 187, Line 53] people who reflect.  
[Page 187, Line 54] 43. Or have they chosen intercessors other 
[Page 187, Line 55] than Allah? Say, “Even though they have no 
[Page 187, Line 56] power over anything, and are devoid of rea-
[Page 187, Line 57] son?”  
[Page 187, Line 58] 44. Say, “All intercession is up to Allah. To 
[Page 187, Line 59] Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and 
[Page 187, Line 60] the earth. Then to Him you will be retur ned.”  
[Page 187, Line 61] 45. When Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts 
[Page 187, Line 62] of those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
[Page 187, Line 63] shrink with resentment. But when those other than Him are mentioned, they become 
[Page 187, Line 64] filled with joy.  
[Page 187, Line 65] 46. Say, “Our God, Initiator of the heavens and 
[Page 187, Line 66] the earth, Kn ower of all secrets and declara-
[Page 187, Line 67] tions. You will judge between your servants regarding what they had differed about.”  
[Page 187, Line 68] 47. If those who did wrong owned everything 
[Page 187, Line 69] on earth, and the like of it with it, they would redeem themselves with it from the terrible 
[Page 187, Line 70] suffering on the Day of Resurrection. But 
[Page 187, Line 71] there will appear to them from Allah what 
[Page 187, Line 72] they never anticipated.  
[Page 187, Line 73] 48. There will appear to them the evils of their 
[Page 187, Line 74] deeds, and they will be surrounded by what they used to ridicule.  
[Page 187, Line 75] 49. When adversity touches the huma n being, 
[Page 187, Line 76] he calls on Us. But then, when We favor him 
[Page 187, Line 77] with a blessing from Us, he says, “I have at-
[Page 187, Line 78] tained this by virtue of my knowledge.” How-
[Page 187, Line 79] ever, it is a test, but most of them do not 
[Page 187, Line 80] know.  
[Page 187, Line 81] 176 
[Page 188, Line 1] 39.  THRONGS   (az-Zumar)  
[Page 188, Line 2] 50. Those before them said it, but what they 
[Page 188, Line 3] had earned did not avail them.  
[Page 188, Line 4] 51. The evils of their deeds caught up with 
[Page 188, Line 5] them. And the wrongdoers among these will 
[Page 188, Line 6] also be afflicted by the evils of what they 
[Page 188, Line 7] earned, and they cannot prevent it.  
[Page 188, Line 8] 52. Do they not know that Allah extends the 
[Page 188, Line 9] provision to whomever He wills, and con-
[Page 188, Line 10] stricts it? In that are signs for people who be-
[Page 188, Line 11] lieve.  
[Page 188, Line 12] 53. Say, “O My servants who have transgressed 
[Page 188, Line 13] against themselves: do not despair of Allah’s 
[Page 188, Line 14] mercy, for Allah forgives all sins. He is indeed 
[Page 188, Line 15] the Forgiver, the Clement.”  
[Page 188, Line 16] 54. And turn to your Lord, and  submit to Him, 
[Page 188, Line 17] before the retribution comes upon you. Then you will not be helped.  
[Page 188, Line 18] 55. And follow the best of what was revealed to 
[Page 188, Line 19] you from your Lord, before the punishment 
[Page 188, Line 20] comes upon you suddenly, while you are un-
[Page 188, Line 21] aware.  
[Page 188, Line 22] 56. So that a soul may not say, “H ow sorry I 
[Page 188, Line 23] am, for having neglected my duty to Allah, 
[Page 188, Line 24] and for having been of the scoffers.”  
[Page 188, Line 25] 57. Or say, “Had Allah guided me; I would 
[Page 188, Line 26] have been of the pious.”  
[Page 188, Line 27] 58. Or say, when it sees the penalty, “If only I 
[Page 188, Line 28] had another chance, I would be of the virtu-ous.”  
[Page 188, Line 29] 59. Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you, 
[Page 188, Line 30] but you called them lies, turned arrogant, and 
[Page 188, Line 31] were of the faithless.  
[Page 188, Line 32] 60. On the Day of Resurrection, you will see 
[Page 188, Line 33] those who told lies about Allah with their 
[Page 188, Line 34] faces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell 
[Page 188, Line 35] for the arrogant?  
[Page 188, Line 36] 61. And Allah will save those who maintained 
[Page 188, Line 37] righteousness to their place of salvation. No harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.  
[Page 188, Line 38] 62. Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is 
[Page 188, Line 39] in Charge of all things.  
[Page 188, Line 40] 63. To Him belong the reins of the h eavens 
[Page 188, Line 41] and the earth. But those who blaspheme against the revelations of Allah— it is they 
[Page 188, Line 42] who are the losers.  
[Page 188, Line 43] 64. Say, “Is it other than Allah you instruct me 
[Page 188, Line 44] to worship, you ignorant ones?”  
[Page 188, Line 45] 65. It was revealed to you, and to those before 
[Page 188, Line 46] you, that if you idolize, your works will be in 
[Page 188, Line 47] vain, and you will be of the losers.  
[Page 188, Line 48] 66. Rather, worship Allah, and be of the appre-
[Page 188, Line 49] ciative.  
[Page 188, Line 50] 67. They have not esteemed Allah as He ought 
[Page 188, Line 51] to be esteemed. The entire earth will be in His 
[Page 188, Line 52] grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the  
[Page 188, Line 53] heavens will be folded in His right. Immacu-
[Page 188, Line 54] late is He, and Transcendent He is beyond the 
[Page 188, Line 55] associations they make.  
[Page 188, Line 56] 68. And the Trumpet will be sounded, where-
[Page 188, Line 57] upon everyone in the heavens and the earth 
[Page 188, Line 58] will be stunned, except whomever Allah wills. Then it wi ll be sounded another time, where-
[Page 188, Line 59] upon they will rise up, looking on.  
[Page 188, Line 60] 69. And the earth will shine with the Light of 
[Page 188, Line 61] its Lord; and the Book will be put in place; 
[Page 188, Line 62] and the prophets and the witnesses will be 
[Page 188, Line 63] brought in; and Judgment will be passed 
[Page 188, Line 64] among them e quitably, and they will not be 
[Page 188, Line 65] wronged.  
[Page 188, Line 66] 70. And every soul will be fully compensated 
[Page 188, Line 67] for what it had done. He is well aware of what 
[Page 188, Line 68] they do.  
[Page 188, Line 69] 71. Those who disbelieved will be driven to 
[Page 188, Line 70] Hell in throngs. Until, when they have 
[Page 188, Line 71] reached it, and its gates are op ened, its keep-
[Page 188, Line 72] ers will say to them, “Did not messengers 
[Page 188, Line 73] from among you come to you, reciting to you 
[Page 188, Line 74] the revelations of your Lord, and warning 
[Page 188, Line 75] you of the meeting of this Day of yours?” 
[Page 188, Line 76] They will say, “Yes, but the verdict of punish-
[Page 188, Line 77] ment is justified against the disbelievers.”  
[Page 188, Line 78] 72. It will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell, to 
[Page 188, Line 79] abide therein eternally.” How wretched is the 
[Page 188, Line 80] destination of the arrogant.  
[Page 188, Line 81] 73. And those who feared their Lord will be led 
[Page 188, Line 82] to Paradise in throngs. Until, when they have 
[Page 188, Line 83] reached it, and it s gates are opened, its keep-
[Page 188, Line 84] ers will say to them, “Peace be upon you, you 
[Page 188, Line 85] 177 
[Page 189, Line 1] 40.  FORGIVER   (Ghafir)  
[Page 189, Line 2] have been good, so enter it, to abide therein 
[Page 189, Line 3] eternally.”  
[Page 189, Line 4] 74. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who 
[Page 189, Line 5] has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us 
[Page 189, Line 6] inherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we 
[Page 189, Line 7] please.” How excellent is the reward of the workers.  
[Page 189, Line 8] 75. And you will see the angels hovering 
[Page 189, Line 9] around the Throne, glorifying their Lord 
[Page 189, Line 10] with praise. And it will be judged between 
[Page 189, Line 11] them equitably, and it will be said, “Praise be 
[Page 189, Line 12] to Allah, Lord of t he Worlds.”  

[Page 189, Line 14] 40. FORGIVER  
[Page 189, Line 15] (Ghafir ) 
[Page 189, Line 16] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 189, Line 17] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 189, Line 18] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 189, Line 19] 2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
[Page 189, Line 20] Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.  
[Page 189, Line 21] 3. Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se-
[Page 189, Line 22] vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty. 
[Page 189, Line 23] There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti-
[Page 189, Line 24] mate return.  
[Page 189, Line 25] 4. None argues against Allah’s revelations ex-
[Page 189, Line 26] cept those who disbelieve. So do not be im-
[Page 189, Line 27] pressed by their activities in the land.  
[Page 189, Line 28] 5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the 
[Page 189, Line 29] truth, as did t he confederates after them. 
[Page 189, Line 30] Every community plotted against their mes-
[Page 189, Line 31] senger, to capture him. And they argued with 
[Page 189, Line 32] falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I 
[Page 189, Line 33] seized them. What a punishment it was!  
[Page 189, Line 34] 6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re-
[Page 189, Line 35] alized against  those who disbelieve, that they 
[Page 189, Line 36] are to be inmates of the Fire.  
[Page 189, Line 37] 7. Those who carry the Throne, and those 
[Page 189, Line 38] around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and 
[Page 189, Line 39] believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for 
[Page 189, Line 40] those who believe: “Our Lord, You have en-
[Page 189, Line 41] compassed everything in mercy and 
[Page 189, Line 42] knowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the 
[Page 189, Line 43] agony of the Blaze.  8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar-
[Page 189, Line 44] dens of Eternity, which You have promised 
[Page 189, Line 45] them, and the righteous among their parents, 
[Page 189, Line 46] and their spouses, and their offspring. You 
[Page 189, Line 47] are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.  
[Page 189, Line 48] 9. And shield them from the evil deeds. 
[Page 189, Line 49] Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, 
[Page 189, Line 50] on that Day, You have had mercy on him. 
[Page 189, Line 51] That is the supreme achievement.”  
[Page 189, Line 52] 10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed, 
[Page 189, Line 53] “The loathing of Allah is greater than your 
[Page 189, Line 54] loathing of yourselves —for you were invited 
[Page 189, Line 55] to the faith, but you refused.”  
[Page 189, Line 56] 11. They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die 
[Page 189, Line 57] twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we 
[Page 189, Line 58] acknowledge our s ins. Is there any way out?”  
[Page 189, Line 59] 12. That is because when Allah alone was 
[Page 189, Line 60] called upon, you disbelieved; but when others 
[Page 189, Line 61] were associated with Him, you believed. 
[Page 189, Line 62] Judgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the 
[Page 189, Line 63] Majestic.  
[Page 189, Line 64] 13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and 
[Page 189, Line 65] send s down sustenance from the sky for you. 
[Page 189, Line 66] But none pays heed except the repentant.  
[Page 189, Line 67] 14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to 
[Page 189, Line 68] Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.  
[Page 189, Line 69] 15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He 
[Page 189, Line 70] conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon 
[Page 189, Line 71] whomever He wills of His servants, to warn 
[Page 189, Line 72] of the Day of Encounter.  
[Page 189, Line 73] 16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing 
[Page 189, Line 74] about them will be concealed from Allah. “To 
[Page 189, Line 75] whom does the sovereignty belong today?” 
[Page 189, Line 76] “To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”  
[Page 189, Line 77] 17. On that Day , every soul will be recom-
[Page 189, Line 78] pensed for what it had earned. There will be 
[Page 189, Line 79] no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set-
[Page 189, Line 80] tle accounts.  
[Page 189, Line 81] 18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence, 
[Page 189, Line 82] when the hearts are at the throats, choking 
[Page 189, Line 83] them. The evildoers will have no intimate 
[Page 189, Line 84] friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.  
[Page 189, Line 85] 19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and 
[Page 189, Line 86] what the hearts conceal.  
[Page 189, Line 87] 178 
[Page 190, Line 1] 40.  FORGIVER   (Ghafir)  
[Page 190, Line 2] 20. Allah judges with justice, while those 
[Page 190, Line 3] whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge 
[Page 190, Line 4] with anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing, 
[Page 190, Line 5] the See ing. 
[Page 190, Line 6] 21. Have they not travelled through the earth, 
[Page 190, Line 7] and seen the consequences for those before 
[Page 190, Line 8] them? They were stronger than them, and 
[Page 190, Line 9] they left more impact on earth. But Allah 
[Page 190, Line 10] seized them for their sins, and they had no 
[Page 190, Line 11] defender against Allah.  
[Page 190, Line 12] 22. That is  because their messengers used to 
[Page 190, Line 13] come to them with clear proofs, but they dis-
[Page 190, Line 14] believed, so Allah seized them. He is Strong, 
[Page 190, Line 15] Severe in retribution.  
[Page 190, Line 16] 23. We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear 
[Page 190, Line 17] authority.  
[Page 190, Line 18] 24. To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But 
[Page 190, Line 19] they said, “A lying sorcerer.”  
[Page 190, Line 20] 25. Then, when he came to them with the truth 
[Page 190, Line 21] from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those who have believed with him, and spare their daughters.” But the scheming of the unbe-
[Page 190, Line 22] lievers can only go astray.  
[Page 190, Line 23] 26. Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kil l Moses, and 
[Page 190, Line 24] let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may change your religion, or spread disorder in 
[Page 190, Line 25] the land.”  
[Page 190, Line 26] 27. Moses said, “I have sought the protection 
[Page 190, Line 27] of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant 
[Page 190, Line 28] who does not believe in the Day of Account.”  
[Page 190, Line 29] 28. A belie ving man from Pharaoh's family, 
[Page 190, Line 30] who had concealed his faith, said, “Are you 
[Page 190, Line 31] going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is Allah,’ and he has brought you clear proofs 
[Page 190, Line 32] from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, the n 
[Page 190, Line 33] some of what he promises you will befall you. 
[Page 190, Line 34] Allah does not guide the extravagant im-
[Page 190, Line 35] poster.  
[Page 190, Line 36] 29. O my people! Yours is the dominion today, 
[Page 190, Line 37] supreme in the land; but who will help us 
[Page 190, Line 38] against Allah’s might, should it fall upon us?” 
[Page 190, Line 39] Pharaoh said, “I do not s how you except what 
[Page 190, Line 40] I see, and I do not guide you except to the path of prudence.”  30. The one who had believed said, “O my peo-
[Page 190, Line 41] ple, I fear for you the like of the day of the confederates.  
[Page 190, Line 42] 31. Like the fate of the people of Noah, and 
[Page 190, Line 43] Aad, and Thamood, and t hose after them. Al-
[Page 190, Line 44] lah wants no injustice for the servants.  
[Page 190, Line 45] 32. O my people, I fear for you the Day of Call-
[Page 190, Line 46] ing Out.  
[Page 190, Line 47] 33. The Day when you will turn and flee, hav-
[Page 190, Line 48] ing no defender against Allah. Whomever Al-
[Page 190, Line 49] lah misguides has no guide.”  
[Page 190, Line 50] 34. Joseph had come to you with clear revela-
[Page 190, Line 51] tions, but you continued to doubt what he 
[Page 190, Line 52] came to you with. Until, when he perished, you said, “Allah will never send a messenger 
[Page 190, Line 53] after him.” Thus Allah leads astray the outra-
[Page 190, Line 54] geous skeptic.  
[Page 190, Line 55] 35. Those who argue against Allah’s revela-
[Page 190, Line 56] tions, without any proof having come to 
[Page 190, Line 57] them —a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and 
[Page 190, Line 58] of those who believe. Thus Allah seals the 
[Page 190, Line 59] heart of every proud bully.  
[Page 190, Line 60] 36. And Pharaoh said, “O Hamaan, build me a 
[Page 190, Line 61] tower, that I may reach the pathways.  
[Page 190, Line 62] 37. The pat hways of the heavens, so that I may 
[Page 190, Line 63] glance at the God of Moses; though I think he 
[Page 190, Line 64] is lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were 
[Page 190, Line 65] made to appear good to him, and he was 
[Page 190, Line 66] averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was 
[Page 190, Line 67] only in defeat.  
[Page 190, Line 68] 38. The one who had believed said,  “O my peo-
[Page 190, Line 69] ple, follow me, and I will guide you to the 
[Page 190, Line 70] path of rectitude.”  
[Page 190, Line 71] 39. “O my people, the life of this world is noth-
[Page 190, Line 72] ing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter 
[Page 190, Line 73] is the Home of Permanence.  
[Page 190, Line 74] 40. Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only 
[Page 190, Line 75] with its like. But whoever works righteous-
[Page 190, Line 76] ness, whether male or female, and is a be-
[Page 190, Line 77] liever —these will enter Paradise, where they 
[Page 190, Line 78] will be provided for without account.  
[Page 190, Line 79] 41. O my people, how is it that I call you to sal-
[Page 190, Line 80] vation, and you call me to the Fire?  
[Page 190, Line 81] 179 
[Page 191, Line 1] 40.  FORGIVER   (Ghafir)  
[Page 191, Line 2] 42. You call me to reject Allah, and to associate 
[Page 191, Line 3] with Him what I have no knowledge of, while 
[Page 191, Line 4] I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.  
[Page 191, Line 5] 43. Without a doubt, what you call me to has 
[Page 191, Line 6] no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and 
[Page 191, Line 7] our turning back is to Allah; and the trans-
[Page 191, Line 8] gressors ar e the inmates of the Fire.  
[Page 191, Line 9] 44. You will remember what I am telling you, 
[Page 191, Line 10] so I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Ob-
[Page 191, Line 11] servant of the servants.”  
[Page 191, Line 12] 45. So Allah protected him from the evils of 
[Page 191, Line 13] their scheming, while a terrible torment be-sieged Pharaoh’s clan.  
[Page 191, Line 14] 46. The Fire. They will be exposed to it morn-
[Page 191, Line 15] ing and evening. And on the Day the Hour 
[Page 191, Line 16] takes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the 
[Page 191, Line 17] most intense agony.”  
[Page 191, Line 18] 47. As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will 
[Page 191, Line 19] say to those who were arrogant, “We were 
[Page 191, Line 20] followers of yours; will you then spare us a 
[Page 191, Line 21] portion of the Fire?”  
[Page 191, Line 22] 48. Those who were arrogant will say, “We are 
[Page 191, Line 23] all in it; Allah has judged between the serv-
[Page 191, Line 24] ants.”  
[Page 191, Line 25] 49. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers 
[Page 191, Line 26] of Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suf-
[Page 191, Line 27] fering for one da y.” 
[Page 191, Line 28] 50. They will say, “Did not your messengers 
[Page 191, Line 29] come to you with clear signs?” They will say, 
[Page 191, Line 30] “Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the prayers of the disbelievers will always be in 
[Page 191, Line 31] vain.”  
[Page 191, Line 32] 51. Most surely We will support Our messen-
[Page 191, Line 33] gers and those who believ e, in this life, and on 
[Page 191, Line 34] the Day the witnesses arise.  
[Page 191, Line 35] 52. The Day when their excuses will not profit 
[Page 191, Line 36] the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon 
[Page 191, Line 37] them, and they will have the Home of Misery.  
[Page 191, Line 38] 53. We gave Moses guidance, and made the 
[Page 191, Line 39] Children of Israel inherit the Scripture.  
[Page 191, Line 40] 54. A guide and a reminder for those endowed 
[Page 191, Line 41] with reason.  55. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true. 
[Page 191, Line 42] And ask forgiveness for your sin, and pro-
[Page 191, Line 43] claim the praise of your Lord evening and 
[Page 191, Line 44] morning.  
[Page 191, Line 45] 56. Those who dispute regarding Allah’s reve-
[Page 191, Line 46] lations without any authority having come to 
[Page 191, Line 47] them —there is nothing in their hearts but the 
[Page 191, Line 48] feeling of greatness, which they will never at-
[Page 191, Line 49] tain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All -
[Page 191, Line 50] Hearing, the All -Seeing.  
[Page 191, Line 51] 57. Certainly the creation of the heavens  and 
[Page 191, Line 52] the earth is greater than the creation of hu-
[Page 191, Line 53] manity, but most people do not know.  
[Page 191, Line 54] 58. Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor 
[Page 191, Line 55] are those who believe and work righteousness equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.  
[Page 191, Line 56] 59. Indeed, the Hour is coming;  there is no 
[Page 191, Line 57] doubt about it; but most people do not be-
[Page 191, Line 58] lieve.  
[Page 191, Line 59] 60. Your Lord has said, “Pray to Me, and I will 
[Page 191, Line 60] respond to you. But those who are too proud 
[Page 191, Line 61] to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.”  
[Page 191, Line 62] 61. It is Allah Who made the night for you, that 
[Page 191, Line 63] you may rest therein; and the day allowing 
[Page 191, Line 64] sight. Allah is gracious towards the people, but most people do not give thanks.  
[Page 191, Line 65] 62. Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all 
[Page 191, Line 66] things. There is no god except Him; so how could you turn away?  
[Page 191, Line 67] 63. Thus are turned away those who dispute 
[Page 191, Line 68] the signs of Allah.  
[Page 191, Line 69] 64. It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for 
[Page 191, Line 70] you, and the sky a structure. And He de-
[Page 191, Line 71] signed you, and designed you well; and He provided you with the good things. Such is 
[Page 191, Line 72] Allah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of 
[Page 191, Line 73] the Worl ds. 
[Page 191, Line 74] 65. He is the Living One. There is no god ex-
[Page 191, Line 75] cept He. So pray to Him, devoting your reli-
[Page 191, Line 76] gion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of 
[Page 191, Line 77] the Worlds.  
[Page 191, Line 78] 66. Say, “I was prohibited from worshiping 
[Page 191, Line 79] those you invoke besides Allah, now that 
[Page 191, Line 80] clear revelations have c ome to me from my 
[Page 191, Line 81] 180 
[Page 192, Line 1] 41.  DETAILED   (Fussilat)  
[Page 192, Line 2] Lord; and I was commanded to submit to the 
[Page 192, Line 3] Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 192, Line 4] 67. It is He who created you from dust, then 
[Page 192, Line 5] from a seed, then from an embryo, then He 
[Page 192, Line 6] brings you out as an infant, then He lets you 
[Page 192, Line 7] reach your maturity, then you become el-
[Page 192, Line 8] derly—although some of you die sooner —so 
[Page 192, Line 9] that you may reach a predetermined age, so 
[Page 192, Line 10] that you may understand.  
[Page 192, Line 11] 68. It is He who gives life and death; and when 
[Page 192, Line 12] He decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.  
[Page 192, Line 13] 69. Have you not observed those who dispute 
[Page 192, Line 14] regarding Allah's revelations, how they have 
[Page 192, Line 15] deviated?  
[Page 192, Line 16] 70. Those who call the Book a lie, and what We 
[Page 192, Line 17] sent Our messengers with —they will surely 
[Page 192, Line 18] know.  
[Page 192, Line 19] 71. When the yokes are around their necks, 
[Page 192, Line 20] and they will be dragged by the chains.  
[Page 192, Line 21] 72. Into th e boiling water, then in the Fire they 
[Page 192, Line 22] will be consumed.  
[Page 192, Line 23] 73. Then it will be said to them, “Where are 
[Page 192, Line 24] those you used to deify?  
[Page 192, Line 25] 74. Instead of Allah?” They will say, “They 
[Page 192, Line 26] have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying 
[Page 192, Line 27] to nothing before.” Thus Allah sends the dis-
[Page 192, Line 28] believers astray.  
[Page 192, Line 29] 75. That is because you used to rejoice on earth 
[Page 192, Line 30] in other than the truth, and because you used to behave with vanity.  
[Page 192, Line 31] 76. Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein 
[Page 192, Line 32] forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arro-
[Page 192, Line 33] gant.  
[Page 192, Line 34] 77. So be patient.  The promise of Allah is true. 
[Page 192, Line 35] Whether We show you some of what We have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us 
[Page 192, Line 36] they will be returned.  
[Page 192, Line 37] 78. We sent messengers before you. Some of 
[Page 192, Line 38] them We told you about, and some We did 
[Page 192, Line 39] not tell you about. No messenger can b ring a 
[Page 192, Line 40] miracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when the command of Allah is issued, fair judg-
[Page 192, Line 41] ment will be passed, and there and then the seekers of vanity will lose.  79. Allah is He who created the domestic ani-
[Page 192, Line 42] mals for you —some for you to ride, and some 
[Page 192, Line 43] you eat.  
[Page 192, Line 44] 80. And in them you have other benefits as 
[Page 192, Line 45] well, and through them you satisfy your 
[Page 192, Line 46] needs. And on them, and on the ships, you 
[Page 192, Line 47] are transported.  
[Page 192, Line 48] 81. And He shows you His signs. So which of 
[Page 192, Line 49] Allah’s signs will you deny?  
[Page 192, Line 50] 82. Have they not journeyed throug h the land, 
[Page 192, Line 51] and seen the outcome for those before them? 
[Page 192, Line 52] They were more numerous than they, and 
[Page 192, Line 53] had greater power and influence in the land. 
[Page 192, Line 54] But what they had achieved availed them 
[Page 192, Line 55] nothing.  
[Page 192, Line 56] 83. When their messengers came to them with 
[Page 192, Line 57] clear proofs, they rejo iced in the knowledge 
[Page 192, Line 58] they had, and the very things they used to rid-icule besieged them.  
[Page 192, Line 59] 84. Then, when they witnessed Our might, 
[Page 192, Line 60] they said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we 
[Page 192, Line 61] reject what we used to associate with Him.”  
[Page 192, Line 62] 85. But their faith could not help them once 
[Page 192, Line 63] they witnessed Our might. This has been Al-
[Page 192, Line 64] lah’s way of dealing with His servants. And 
[Page 192, Line 65] there and then the disbelievers lost.  

[Page 192, Line 67] 41. DETAILED  
[Page 192, Line 68] (Fussilat ) 
[Page 192, Line 69] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 192, Line 70] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 192, Line 71] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 192, Line 72] 2. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the 
[Page 192, Line 73] Most Merciful.  
[Page 192, Line 74] 3. A Scripture whose Verses are detailed, a 
[Page 192, Line 75] Quran in Arabic for people who know.  
[Page 192, Line 76] 4. Bringing good news, and giving warnings. 
[Page 192, Line 77] But most of them turn away, so they do not 
[Page 192, Line 78] listen.  
[Page 192, Line 79] 5. And they say, “Our hearts are screened 
[Page 192, Line 80] from what you call us to, and in our ears is 
[Page 192, Line 81] deafness, and between us and you is a barrier. 
[Page 192, Line 82] So do what you want, and so will we.”  
[Page 192, Line 83] 181 
[Page 193, Line 1] 41.  DETAILED   (Fussilat)  
[Page 193, Line 2] 6. Say, “I am only a human like you; it is in-
[Page 193, Line 3] spired in me that your God is One God. So be 
[Page 193, Line 4] upright towards Him, and seek forgiveness 
[Page 193, Line 5] from Him.” And woe to the idolaters.  
[Page 193, Line 6] 7. Those who do not pay the alms; and regard-
[Page 193, Line 7] ing the Hereafter, they are disbelievers.  
[Page 193, Line 8] 8. As for those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 193, Line 9] deeds —for them is a reward uninterrupted.  
[Page 193, Line 10] 9. Say, “Do you reject the One who created the 
[Page 193, Line 11] earth in two days? And you attribute equals 
[Page 193, Line 12] to Him? That is the Lord of the Universe.”  
[Page 193, Line 13] 10. He placed stabilizers over it; and blessed it; 
[Page 193, Line 14] and planned its provisions in four days, equally to the seekers.  
[Page 193, Line 15] 11. Then He turned to the sky, and it was 
[Page 193, Line 16] smoke, and sa id to it and to the earth, “Come, 
[Page 193, Line 17] willingly or unwillingly.” They said, “We come willingly.”  
[Page 193, Line 18] 12. So He completed them as seven universes 
[Page 193, Line 19] in two days, and He assigned to each universe 
[Page 193, Line 20] its laws. And We decorated the lower uni-
[Page 193, Line 21] verse with lamps, and for protect ion. That is 
[Page 193, Line 22] the design of the Almighty, the All -Knowing.  
[Page 193, Line 23] 13. But if they turn away, say, “I have warned 
[Page 193, Line 24] you of a thunderbolt, like the thunderbolt of 
[Page 193, Line 25] Aad and Thamood.”  
[Page 193, Line 26] 14. Their messengers came to them, from be-
[Page 193, Line 27] fore them and from behind them, saying, “Do 
[Page 193, Line 28] not worship anyone but Allah.” They said, 
[Page 193, Line 29] “Had our Lord willed, He would have sent 
[Page 193, Line 30] down angels; Therefore, we reject what you 
[Page 193, Line 31] are sent with.”  
[Page 193, Line 32] 15. As for Aad, they turned arrogant on earth, 
[Page 193, Line 33] and opposed justice, and said, “Who is more 
[Page 193, Line 34] powerful than us?” Have they not considered 
[Page 193, Line 35] that Allah, who created them, is more power-
[Page 193, Line 36] ful than they? And they went on denying Our 
[Page 193, Line 37] revelations.  
[Page 193, Line 38] 16. So We unleashed upon them a screaming 
[Page 193, Line 39] wind, for a few miserable days, to make them 
[Page 193, Line 40] taste the punishment of shame in this life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more 
[Page 193, Line 41] shameful; and they will not be saved.  
[Page 193, Line 42] 17. And as for Thamood, We guided them, but 
[Page 193, Line 43] they preferred blindness over guidance. So the thunderbolt of the humiliating punish-
[Page 193, Line 44] ment seized them, because of what they used 
[Page 193, Line 45] to earn . 
[Page 193, Line 46] 18. And We saved those who believed and 
[Page 193, Line 47] were righteous.  
[Page 193, Line 48] 19. The Day when Allah’s enemies are herded 
[Page 193, Line 49] into the Fire, forcibly.  
[Page 193, Line 50] 20. Until, when they have reached it, their 
[Page 193, Line 51] hearing, and their sight, and their skins will testify against them regarding what th ey used 
[Page 193, Line 52] to do.  
[Page 193, Line 53] 21. And they will say to their skins, “Why did 
[Page 193, Line 54] you testify against us?” They will say, “Allah, Who made all things speak, made us speak. It is He who created you the first time, and to 
[Page 193, Line 55] Him you are returned.”  
[Page 193, Line 56] 22. You were unable to hide yours elves from 
[Page 193, Line 57] your hearing, and your sight, and your skins, to prevent them from testifying against you, 
[Page 193, Line 58] and you imagined that Allah was unaware of 
[Page 193, Line 59] much of what you do.  
[Page 193, Line 60] 23. It is that thought of yours about your Lord 
[Page 193, Line 61] that led you to ruin —so you became of the 
[Page 193, Line 62] losers.  
[Page 193, Line 63] 24. If they endure patiently, the Fire will be 
[Page 193, Line 64] their residence; and if they make up excuses, they will not be pardoned.  
[Page 193, Line 65] 25. We had assigned companions for them, 
[Page 193, Line 66] who glamorized to them what was in front of 
[Page 193, Line 67] them, and what was behind them. And the Wor d proved true against them in communi-
[Page 193, Line 68] ties of jinn and humans that have passed 
[Page 193, Line 69] away before them. They were losers.  
[Page 193, Line 70] 26. Those who disbelieve say, “Do not listen to 
[Page 193, Line 71] this Quran, and talk over it, so that you may 
[Page 193, Line 72] prevail.”  
[Page 193, Line 73] 27. We will make those who disbelieve taste an 
[Page 193, Line 74] intense agony, and We will recompense them according to the worst of what they used to 
[Page 193, Line 75] do. 
[Page 193, Line 76] 28. Such is the recompense of Allah’s ene-
[Page 193, Line 77] mies —the Fire— where they will have their 
[Page 193, Line 78] permanent home, in recompense for having disregarded Our revelations.  
[Page 193, Line 79] 182 
[Page 194, Line 1] 41.  DETAILED   (Fussilat)  
[Page 194, Line 2] 29. Those who disbelieved will say, “Our Lord, 
[Page 194, Line 3] show us those who led us astray —among jinn 
[Page 194, Line 4] and humans —and we will trample them un-
[Page 194, Line 5] der our feet, so they become of the lowest.”  
[Page 194, Line 6] 30. Surely, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah,” 
[Page 194, Line 7] and then go straight, the angels will d escend 
[Page 194, Line 8] upon them: “Do not fear, and do not grieve, 
[Page 194, Line 9] but rejoice in the news of the Garden which 
[Page 194, Line 10] you were promised.  
[Page 194, Line 11] 31. We are your allies in this life and in the 
[Page 194, Line 12] Hereafter, wherein you will have whatever 
[Page 194, Line 13] your souls desire, and you will have therein 
[Page 194, Line 14] whatever  you call for.  
[Page 194, Line 15] 32. As Hospitality from an All -Forgiving, 
[Page 194, Line 16] Merciful One.”  
[Page 194, Line 17] 33. And who is better in speech than someone 
[Page 194, Line 18] who calls to Allah, and acts with integrity, and says, “I am of those who submit”?  
[Page 194, Line 19] 34. Good and evil are not equal. Repel evil with 
[Page 194, Line 20] good, a nd the person who was your enemy 
[Page 194, Line 21] becomes like an intimate friend.  
[Page 194, Line 22] 35. But none will attain it except those who 
[Page 194, Line 23] persevere, and none will attain it except the 
[Page 194, Line 24] very fortunate.  
[Page 194, Line 25] 36. When a temptation from the Devil pro-
[Page 194, Line 26] vokes you, seek refuge in Allah; He is the 
[Page 194, Line 27] Hearer, the Knower.  
[Page 194, Line 28] 37. And of His signs are the night and the day, 
[Page 194, Line 29] and the sun and the moon. Do not bow down 
[Page 194, Line 30] to the sun, nor to the moon, but bow down to Allah, Who created them both, if it is Him 
[Page 194, Line 31] that you serve.  
[Page 194, Line 32] 38. But if they are too proud —those in the  
[Page 194, Line 33] presence of your Lord praise Him night and 
[Page 194, Line 34] day, and without ever tiring.  
[Page 194, Line 35] 39. And of His signs is that you see the land 
[Page 194, Line 36] still. But when We send down water upon it, 
[Page 194, Line 37] it stirs and grows. Surely, He Who revived it will revive the dead. He is Able to do all 
[Page 194, Line 38] things. 
[Page 194, Line 39] 40. Those who despise Our revelations are not 
[Page 194, Line 40] hidden from Us. Is he who is hurled into the Fire better? Or he who arrives safely on the 
[Page 194, Line 41] Day of Resurrection? Do as you please; He is 
[Page 194, Line 42] Seeing of everything you do.  41. Those who reject the Reminder when it  has 
[Page 194, Line 43] come to them —it is an invincible Book.  
[Page 194, Line 44] 42. Falsehood cannot approach it, from before 
[Page 194, Line 45] it or behind it. It is a revelation from One Wise and Praiseworthy.  
[Page 194, Line 46] 43. Nothing is said to you but was said to the 
[Page 194, Line 47] Messengers before you: your Lord is Posses-
[Page 194, Line 48] sor of Forgiveness, and Possessor of Painful 
[Page 194, Line 49] Repayment.  
[Page 194, Line 50] 44. Had We made it a Quran in a foreign lan-
[Page 194, Line 51] guage, they would have said, “If only its 
[Page 194, Line 52] verses were made clear.” Non- Arabic and an 
[Page 194, Line 53] Arab? Say, “For those who believe, it is guid-
[Page 194, Line 54] ance and healing. But as for those w ho do not 
[Page 194, Line 55] believe: there is heaviness in their ears, and it 
[Page 194, Line 56] is blindness for them. These are being called 
[Page 194, Line 57] from a distant place.”  
[Page 194, Line 58] 45. We gave Moses the Book, but disputes 
[Page 194, Line 59] arose concerning it. Were it not for a prior 
[Page 194, Line 60] decree from your Lord, judgment would have been pronounced between them. But they are 
[Page 194, Line 61] in perplexing doubt concerning it.  
[Page 194, Line 62] 46. Whoever acts righteously does so for him-
[Page 194, Line 63] self; and  whoever works evil does so against 
[Page 194, Line 64] himself. Your Lord is not unjust to the serv-
[Page 194, Line 65] ants.  
[Page 194, Line 66] 47. To Him is referred the knowledge of the 
[Page 194, Line 67] Hour. No fruit emerges from its sheath, and no female conceives or delivers, except with 
[Page 194, Line 68] His knowledge. And on the Day when He  
[Page 194, Line 69] calls out to them, “Where are My associates?” 
[Page 194, Line 70] They will say, “We admit to you, none of us 
[Page 194, Line 71] is a witness.”  
[Page 194, Line 72] 48. What they used to pray to before will for-
[Page 194, Line 73] sake them, and they will realize that they have 
[Page 194, Line 74] no escape.  
[Page 194, Line 75] 49. The human being never tires of praying for  
[Page 194, Line 76] good things; but when adversity afflicts him, 
[Page 194, Line 77] he despairs and loses hope.  
[Page 194, Line 78] 50. And when We let him taste a mercy from 
[Page 194, Line 79] Us, after the adversity that had afflicted him, 
[Page 194, Line 80] he will say, “This is mine, and I do not think 
[Page 194, Line 81] that the Hour is coming; and even if I am r e-
[Page 194, Line 82] turned to my Lord, I will have the very best 
[Page 194, Line 83] 183 
[Page 195, Line 1] 42.  CONSULTATION   (ash-Shura)  
[Page 195, Line 2] with Him.” We will inform those who disbe-
[Page 195, Line 3] lieve of what they did, and We will make 
[Page 195, Line 4] them taste an awful punishment.  
[Page 195, Line 5] 51. When We provide comfort for the human 
[Page 195, Line 6] being, he withdraws and distances himself; 
[Page 195, Line 7] but when ad versity befalls him, he starts 
[Page 195, Line 8] lengthy prayers.  
[Page 195, Line 9] 52. Say, “Have you considered? If it is from Al-
[Page 195, Line 10] lah and you reject it —who is further astray 
[Page 195, Line 11] than he who is cutoff and alienated?”  
[Page 195, Line 12] 53. We will show them Our proofs on the ho-
[Page 195, Line 13] rizons, and in their very souls, unti l it be-
[Page 195, Line 14] comes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it 
[Page 195, Line 15] not sufficient that your Lord is witness over 
[Page 195, Line 16] everything?  
[Page 195, Line 17] 54. Surely they are in doubt about the encoun-
[Page 195, Line 18] ter with their Lord. Surely He comprehends 
[Page 195, Line 19] everything.  

[Page 195, Line 21] 42. CONSULTATION  
[Page 195, Line 22] (ash-Shura ) 
[Page 195, Line 23] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 195, Line 24] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 195, Line 25] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 195, Line 26] 2. Ayn, Seen, Qaf.  
[Page 195, Line 27] 3. Thus He inspires you, and those before 
[Page 195, Line 28] you—Allah the Almighty, the Wise.  
[Page 195, Line 29] 4. To him belongs everything in the heavens 
[Page 195, Line 30] and everything on earth. He is the Sublime, the Magnificent.  
[Page 195, Line 31] 5. The heavens above them almost burst apart, 
[Page 195, Line 32] while the angels glorify the praises of their 
[Page 195, Line 33] Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth. 
[Page 195, Line 34] Allah is indeed the Forgiver, the Merciful.  
[Page 195, Line 35] 6. As for those who take masters other than 
[Page 195, Line 36] Him: Allah is in charge of them, and  you are 
[Page 195, Line 37] not responsible for them.  
[Page 195, Line 38] 7. Thus We inspired you with an Arabic 
[Page 195, Line 39] Quran, that you may warn the Central City 
[Page 195, Line 40] and whoever is around it, and to warn of the 
[Page 195, Line 41] Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt; 
[Page 195, Line 42] a group in the Garden, and a group in the 
[Page 195, Line 43] Furnace.  8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them 
[Page 195, Line 44] one community, but He admits into His 
[Page 195, Line 45] mercy whomever He wills. As for the wrong-
[Page 195, Line 46] doers, they will have no protector and no sav-
[Page 195, Line 47] ior. 
[Page 195, Line 48] 9. Or have they adopted protectors besides 
[Page 195, Line 49] him? But Allah is the Protector, and H e gives 
[Page 195, Line 50] life to the dead, and He has power over all 
[Page 195, Line 51] things.  
[Page 195, Line 52] 10. Whatever matter you differ about, its judg-
[Page 195, Line 53] ment rests with Allah. “Such is Allah, my 
[Page 195, Line 54] Lord, in Whom I trust, and unto Him I re-
[Page 195, Line 55] pent.”  
[Page 195, Line 56] 11. Originator of the heavens and the earth. He 
[Page 195, Line 57] made for you mates from among yourselves, 
[Page 195, Line 58] and pairs of animals, by means of which He multiplies you. There is nothing like Him. He 
[Page 195, Line 59] is the Hearing, the Seeing.  
[Page 195, Line 60] 12. To Him belongs absolute control of the 
[Page 195, Line 61] heavens and the earth. He spreads the boun-ties to whomever He wills , or reduces it. He 
[Page 195, Line 62] is aware of all things.  
[Page 195, Line 63] 13. He prescribed for you the same religion He 
[Page 195, Line 64] enjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired to you, and what We enjoined upon Abra-
[Page 195, Line 65] ham, and Moses, and Jesus: “You shall up-
[Page 195, Line 66] hold the religion, and be not divided therein. ” 
[Page 195, Line 67] As for the idolaters, what you call them to is 
[Page 195, Line 68] outrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself 
[Page 195, Line 69] whom He wills, and He guides to Himself 
[Page 195, Line 70] whoever repents.  
[Page 195, Line 71] 14. They became divided only after knowledge 
[Page 195, Line 72] came to them, out of resentment among 
[Page 195, Line 73] themselves. Were it no t for a predetermined 
[Page 195, Line 74] decision from your Lord, judgment would 
[Page 195, Line 75] have been pronounced between them. In-
[Page 195, Line 76] deed, those who were made to inherit the 
[Page 195, Line 77] Book after them are in grave doubt about it.  
[Page 195, Line 78] 15. To this go on inviting, and be upright as 
[Page 195, Line 79] you were commanded, and d o not follow 
[Page 195, Line 80] their inclinations, and say, “I believe in what-
[Page 195, Line 81] ever Book Allah has sent down, and I was 
[Page 195, Line 82] commanded to judge between you equitably. 
[Page 195, Line 83] Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our 
[Page 195, Line 84] deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be 
[Page 195, Line 85] no quarrel between us a nd you. Allah will 
[Page 195, Line 86] 184 
[Page 196, Line 1] 42.  CONSULTATION   (ash-Shura)  
[Page 196, Line 2] bring us together, and to Him is the ultimate 
[Page 196, Line 3] return.”  
[Page 196, Line 4] 16. As for those who dispute about Allah after 
[Page 196, Line 5] having answered His call, their argument is 
[Page 196, Line 6] invalid with their Lord; and upon them falls 
[Page 196, Line 7] wrath; and a grievous torment awaits them.  
[Page 196, Line 8] 17. It is Allah who revealed the Book with the 
[Page 196, Line 9] truth, and the Balance. And what will make you realize that perhaps the Hour is near?  
[Page 196, Line 10] 18. Those who do not believe in it seek to has-
[Page 196, Line 11] ten it; but those who believe are apprehensive 
[Page 196, Line 12] of it, and they know it to be the  truth. Abso-
[Page 196, Line 13] lutely, those who question the Hour are in 
[Page 196, Line 14] distant error.  
[Page 196, Line 15] 19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He 
[Page 196, Line 16] provides for whomever He wills. He is the 
[Page 196, Line 17] Powerful, the Honorable.  
[Page 196, Line 18] 20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereaf-
[Page 196, Line 19] ter, We increase for him his harvest; and 
[Page 196, Line 20] whoever desires the harvest of this world, We 
[Page 196, Line 21] give him thereof, and he has no share of the 
[Page 196, Line 22] Hereafter.  
[Page 196, Line 23] 21. Or is it that they have partners who litigate 
[Page 196, Line 24] for them religious laws never authorized by 
[Page 196, Line 25] Allah? Were it not for the conclusive deci-sion,  it would have been settled between 
[Page 196, Line 26] them. The wicked will have a painful punish-
[Page 196, Line 27] ment.  
[Page 196, Line 28] 22. You will see the unjust terrified of what 
[Page 196, Line 29] they have earned, and it will befall them. As 
[Page 196, Line 30] for those who believe and do good deeds, 
[Page 196, Line 31] they will be in the Meadows of the Gardens; 
[Page 196, Line 32] they will have whatever they please in the 
[Page 196, Line 33] presence of their Lord; that is the supreme 
[Page 196, Line 34] blessing.  
[Page 196, Line 35] 23. That is the good news Allah gives to His 
[Page 196, Line 36] servants who believe and do good deeds. Say, 
[Page 196, Line 37] “I ask of you no wage for it, except affection 
[Page 196, Line 38] among the near of kin.” Whoever does a good 
[Page 196, Line 39] deed, We will increase its goodness for him. 
[Page 196, Line 40] Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.  
[Page 196, Line 41] 24. Or do they say, “He forged a lie about Al-
[Page 196, Line 42] lah.” If Allah so willed, He could have sealed 
[Page 196, Line 43] your heart. But Allah obliterates the false, and 
[Page 196, Line 44] confirm the true by His Words. He knows 
[Page 196, Line 45] what is in the hearts.  25. It is He who accepts the repentance of His 
[Page 196, Line 46] worshipers, and remits the sins, and knows 
[Page 196, Line 47] what you do.  
[Page 196, Line 48] 26. And He answers those who believe and do 
[Page 196, Line 49] good deeds, and He increases them of His 
[Page 196, Line 50] grace. But the disbelievers will suffer a terri-
[Page 196, Line 51] ble punishment.  
[Page 196, Line 52] 27. If Allah were to increase the provision to 
[Page 196, Line 53] His servants, they would transgress on earth; but He sends down in precise measure what-
[Page 196, Line 54] ever He wills. Surely, regarding His servants, 
[Page 196, Line 55] He is Expert and Ob servant.  
[Page 196, Line 56] 28. It is He who brings down the rain after they 
[Page 196, Line 57] have despaired, and unfolds His mercy. He is 
[Page 196, Line 58] the Guardian, the Praised.  
[Page 196, Line 59] 29. And of His signs are the creation of the 
[Page 196, Line 60] heavens and the earth, and the creatures He has spread throughout them; and He is  Able 
[Page 196, Line 61] to gather them at will.  
[Page 196, Line 62] 30. Whatever misfortune befalls you, it is be-
[Page 196, Line 63] cause of what your hands have earned; and 
[Page 196, Line 64] yet He pardons much.  
[Page 196, Line 65] 31. You are not the ones to interfere on earth; 
[Page 196, Line 66] and besides Allah, you have no ally, and no helper.  
[Page 196, Line 67] 32. And of His sig ns are the ships sailing the 
[Page 196, Line 68] sea like flags.  
[Page 196, Line 69] 33. If He willed, He could have stilled the 
[Page 196, Line 70] winds, leaving them motionless on its sur-
[Page 196, Line 71] face. Surely in that are signs for every disci-
[Page 196, Line 72] plined, grateful person.  
[Page 196, Line 73] 34. Or He could wreck them, because of what 
[Page 196, Line 74] they have e arned. And yet He pardons much.  
[Page 196, Line 75] 35. Those who dispute Our signs know that 
[Page 196, Line 76] there is no asylum for them.  
[Page 196, Line 77] 36. Whatever thing you are given is only the 
[Page 196, Line 78] provision of this life. But what Allah pos-
[Page 196, Line 79] sesses is better and more lasting for those 
[Page 196, Line 80] who believe and rely o n their Lord.  
[Page 196, Line 81] 37. And those who avoid major sins and inde-
[Page 196, Line 82] cencies; and if they become angry, they for-
[Page 196, Line 83] give.  
[Page 196, Line 84] 38. And those who respond to their Lord, and 
[Page 196, Line 85] pray regularly, and conduct their affairs by 
[Page 196, Line 86] 185 
[Page 197, Line 1] 43.  DECORATIONS   (az-Zukhruf)  
[Page 197, Line 2] mutual consultation, and give of what We 
[Page 197, Line 3] have provided them.  
[Page 197, Line 4] 39. And those who, when wronged, defend 
[Page 197, Line 5] themselves.  
[Page 197, Line 6] 40. The repayment of a bad action is one 
[Page 197, Line 7] equivalent to it. But whoever pardons and 
[Page 197, Line 8] makes reconciliation, his reward lies with Al-
[Page 197, Line 9] lah. He does not love the unjust.  
[Page 197, Line 10] 41. As for those who retaliate after bei ng 
[Page 197, Line 11] wronged, there is no blame on them.  
[Page 197, Line 12] 42. Blame lies on those who wrong people, and 
[Page 197, Line 13] commit aggression in the land without right. 
[Page 197, Line 14] These will have a painful punishment.  
[Page 197, Line 15] 43. But whoever endures patiently and for-
[Page 197, Line 16] gives —that is a sign of real resolve.  
[Page 197, Line 17] 44. Whoe ver Allah leaves astray has no protec-
[Page 197, Line 18] tor apart from Him. And you will see the 
[Page 197, Line 19] transgressors, when they see the torment, 
[Page 197, Line 20] saying, “Is there a way of going back?”  
[Page 197, Line 21] 45. And you will see them exposed to it, cow-
[Page 197, Line 22] ering from disgrace, looking with concealed 
[Page 197, Line 23] eyes. Th ose who believed will say, “The losers 
[Page 197, Line 24] are those who lost themselves and their fam-
[Page 197, Line 25] ilies on the Day of Resurrection.” Indeed, the 
[Page 197, Line 26] evildoers are in a lasting torment.  
[Page 197, Line 27] 46. They will have no allies to support them 
[Page 197, Line 28] against Allah. Whomever Allah leaves astray 
[Page 197, Line 29] has no way out.  
[Page 197, Line 30] 47. Respond to your Lord before there comes 
[Page 197, Line 31] from Allah a Day that cannot be turned back. 
[Page 197, Line 32] You will have no refuge on that Day, and no 
[Page 197, Line 33] possibility of denial.  
[Page 197, Line 34] 48. But if they turn away —We did not send 
[Page 197, Line 35] you as a guardian over them. Your only duty 
[Page 197, Line 36] is communication. Whenever We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but 
[Page 197, Line 37] when misfortune befalls them, as a conse-
[Page 197, Line 38] quence of what their hands have perpetrated, 
[Page 197, Line 39] man turns blasphemous.  
[Page 197, Line 40] 49. To Allah belongs the dominion of the 
[Page 197, Line 41] heavens and the earth. He  creates whatever 
[Page 197, Line 42] He wills. He grants daughters to whomever 
[Page 197, Line 43] He wills, and He grants sons to whomever He 
[Page 197, Line 44] wills.  50. Or He combines them together, males and 
[Page 197, Line 45] females; and He renders whomever He wills 
[Page 197, Line 46] sterile. He is Knowledgeable and Capable.  
[Page 197, Line 47] 51. It is not for  any human that Allah should 
[Page 197, Line 48] speak to him, except by inspiration, or from 
[Page 197, Line 49] behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to 
[Page 197, Line 50] reveal by His permission whatever He wills. 
[Page 197, Line 51] He is All -High, All -Wise.  
[Page 197, Line 52] 52. We thus inspired you spiritually, by Our 
[Page 197, Line 53] command. You did not kn ow what the Scrip-
[Page 197, Line 54] ture is, nor what faith is, but We made it a 
[Page 197, Line 55] light, with which We guide whomever We 
[Page 197, Line 56] will of Our servants. You surely guide to a 
[Page 197, Line 57] straight path.  
[Page 197, Line 58] 53. The path of Allah, to whom belongs every-
[Page 197, Line 59] thing in the heavens and everything on earth. 
[Page 197, Line 60] Indeed, to Allah all matters revert.  

[Page 197, Line 62] 43. DECORATIONS  
[Page 197, Line 63] (az-Zukhruf ) 
[Page 197, Line 64] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 197, Line 65] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 197, Line 66] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 197, Line 67] 2. By the Book that makes things clear.  
[Page 197, Line 68] 3. We made it an Arabic Quran, so that you 
[Page 197, Line 69] may understand.  
[Page 197, Line 70] 4. And it is with Us, in the Source Book, sub-
[Page 197, Line 71] lime and wise.  
[Page 197, Line 72] 5. Shall We hold back the Reminder from you, 
[Page 197, Line 73] since you are a transgressing people?  
[Page 197, Line 74] 6. How many a prophet did We send to the 
[Page 197, Line 75] ancients?  
[Page 197, Line 76] 7. No messenger came to them, but they ridi-
[Page 197, Line 77] culed him.  
[Page 197, Line 78] 8.  We destroyed people more powerful than 
[Page 197, Line 79] they, and so the example of the ancients has 
[Page 197, Line 80] passed away.  
[Page 197, Line 81] 9. And if you asked them, “Who created the 
[Page 197, Line 82] heavens and the earth?” They would say, 
[Page 197, Line 83] “The Mighty, the Knower created them.”  
[Page 197, Line 84] 186 
[Page 198, Line 1] 43.  DECORATIONS   (az-Zukhruf)  
[Page 198, Line 2] 10. He who made the earth a habitat for you, 
[Page 198, Line 3] and traced pathways f or you on it, that you 
[Page 198, Line 4] may be guided.  
[Page 198, Line 5] 11. He who sends down water from the sky in 
[Page 198, Line 6] due proportion; and so We revive thereby a 
[Page 198, Line 7] dead land. Thus you will be brought out.  
[Page 198, Line 8] 12. He Who created all the pairs; and provided 
[Page 198, Line 9] you with ships, and animals on which you 
[Page 198, Line 10] ride. 
[Page 198, Line 11] 13. That you may mount their backs, and re-
[Page 198, Line 12] member the favor of your Lord as you sit 
[Page 198, Line 13] firmly upon them, and say, “Glory be to Him 
[Page 198, Line 14] Who placed these at our service; surely we 
[Page 198, Line 15] could not have done it by ourselves.  
[Page 198, Line 16] 14. And surely, to our Lord we will return.”  
[Page 198, Line 17] 15. Yet they turn one of His servants into a part 
[Page 198, Line 18] of Him. Man is clearly ungrateful.  
[Page 198, Line 19] 16. Or has He chosen for Himself daughters 
[Page 198, Line 20] from what He creates, and favored you with 
[Page 198, Line 21] sons?  
[Page 198, Line 22] 17. Yet when one of them is given news of what 
[Page 198, Line 23] he attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he suppresses grief.  
[Page 198, Line 24] 18. “Someone brought up to be beautiful, and 
[Page 198, Line 25] unable to help in a fight?”  
[Page 198, Line 26] 19. And they appoint the angels, who are serv-
[Page 198, Line 27] ants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have 
[Page 198, Line 28] they witnessed their creation? Their claim 
[Page 198, Line 29] will be recorded, and they will be questioned.  
[Page 198, Line 30] 20. And they say, “Had the Most Gracious 
[Page 198, Line 31] willed, we would not have worshiped them.” 
[Page 198, Line 32] But they have no knowledge of that; they are 
[Page 198, Line 33] merely guessing.  
[Page 198, Line 34] 21. Or have We given them a book prior to this 
[Page 198, Line 35] one, to which they a dhere?  
[Page 198, Line 36] 22. But they say, “We found our parents on a 
[Page 198, Line 37] course, and we are guided in their footsteps.”  
[Page 198, Line 38] 23. Likewise, We sent no warner before you to 
[Page 198, Line 39] any town, but the wealthy among them said, 
[Page 198, Line 40] “We found our parents on a course, and we 
[Page 198, Line 41] are following in their footsteps.” 
[Page 198, Line 42] 24. He would say, “Even if I bring you better 
[Page 198, Line 43] guidance than what you found your parents following?” They would say, “We reject what 
[Page 198, Line 44] you are sent with.”  
[Page 198, Line 45] 25. So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Be-
[Page 198, Line 46] hold, then, what was the fate of those who 
[Page 198, Line 47] deny.  
[Page 198, Line 48] 26. When Abraham said to his father and his 
[Page 198, Line 49] people, “I am innocent of what you worship.  
[Page 198, Line 50] 27. Except for He who created me, for He will 
[Page 198, Line 51] guide me.”  
[Page 198, Line 52] 28. And he made it an enduring word in his 
[Page 198, Line 53] progeny, so that they may return.  
[Page 198, Line 54] 29. I gave these and their forefathe rs some en-
[Page 198, Line 55] joyment, until the truth and a manifest mes-
[Page 198, Line 56] senger came to them.  
[Page 198, Line 57] 30. But when the truth came to them, they 
[Page 198, Line 58] said, “This is sorcery, and we refuse to believe 
[Page 198, Line 59] in it.”  
[Page 198, Line 60] 31. They also said, “If only this Quran was sent 
[Page 198, Line 61] down to a man of importance from t he two 
[Page 198, Line 62] cities.”  
[Page 198, Line 63] 32. Is it they who allocate the mercy of your 
[Page 198, Line 64] Lord? It is We who have allocated their live-
[Page 198, Line 65] lihood in this life, and We elevated some of 
[Page 198, Line 66] them in rank above others, that some of them 
[Page 198, Line 67] would take others in service. But your Lord’s 
[Page 198, Line 68] mercy is better than what they amass.  
[Page 198, Line 69] 33. Were it not that humanity would become a 
[Page 198, Line 70] single community, We would have provided those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious 
[Page 198, Line 71] with roofs of silver to their houses, and stair-
[Page 198, Line 72] ways by which they ascend.  
[Page 198, Line 73] 34. And doors to their houses,  and furnishings 
[Page 198, Line 74] on which they recline.  
[Page 198, Line 75] 35. And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but 
[Page 198, Line 76] the stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with your Lord, is for the righteous.  
[Page 198, Line 77] 36. Whoever shuns the remembrance of the 
[Page 198, Line 78] Most Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to 
[Page 198, Line 79] be his companion.  
[Page 198, Line 80] 37. They hinder them from the path, though 
[Page 198, Line 81] they think they are guided.  
[Page 198, Line 82] 187 
[Page 199, Line 1] 43.  DECORATIONS   (az-Zukhruf)  
[Page 199, Line 2] 38. Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, “If 
[Page 199, Line 3] only there were between me and you the dis-
[Page 199, Line 4] tance of the two Easts.” What an evil com-
[Page 199, Line 5] panion!  
[Page 199, Line 6] 39. It will not benefit you  on that Day, since 
[Page 199, Line 7] you did wrong. You are partners in the suf-
[Page 199, Line 8] fering.  
[Page 199, Line 9] 40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the 
[Page 199, Line 10] blind, and him who is in evident error?  
[Page 199, Line 11] 41. Even if We take you away, We will wreak 
[Page 199, Line 12] vengeance upon them.  
[Page 199, Line 13] 42. Or show you what We have promise d 
[Page 199, Line 14] them; for We have absolute power over them.  
[Page 199, Line 15] 43. So adhere to what is revealed to you. You 
[Page 199, Line 16] are upon a straight path.  
[Page 199, Line 17] 44. It is a message for you, and for your people; 
[Page 199, Line 18] and you will be questioned.  
[Page 199, Line 19] 45. Ask those of Our messengers We sent be-
[Page 199, Line 20] fore you: “Did We appoint gods besides the 
[Page 199, Line 21] Most Gracious to be worshiped?”  
[Page 199, Line 22] 46. We sent Moses with Our revelations to 
[Page 199, Line 23] Pharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, “I am 
[Page 199, Line 24] the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 199, Line 25] 47. But when he showed them Our signs, they 
[Page 199, Line 26] started laughing at them.  
[Page 199, Line 27] 48. Each sign We showed them was more mar-
[Page 199, Line 28] velous than its counterpart. And We afflicted 
[Page 199, Line 29] them with the plagues, so that they may re-
[Page 199, Line 30] pent.  
[Page 199, Line 31] 49. They said, “O sorcerer, pray to your Lord 
[Page 199, Line 32] for us, according to His pledge to you, and 
[Page 199, Line 33] then we will be guided.”  
[Page 199, Line 34] 50. But when We lifted the torment from 
[Page 199, Line 35] them, they immediately broke their promise.  
[Page 199, Line 36] 51. Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, 
[Page 199, Line 37] saying, “O my people, do I not own the King-
[Page 199, Line 38] dom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath 
[Page 199, Line 39] me? Do you not see?  
[Page 199, Line 40] 52. Am I not better than this m iserable wretch, 
[Page 199, Line 41] who can barely express himself?  
[Page 199, Line 42] 53. Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on 
[Page 199, Line 43] him, or they angels came with him in proces-sion?”  54. Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed 
[Page 199, Line 44] him. They were wicked people.  
[Page 199, Line 45] 55. And when they provoked Our wrat h, We 
[Page 199, Line 46] took retribution from them, and We drowned them all.  
[Page 199, Line 47] 56. Thus We made them a precedent and an 
[Page 199, Line 48] example for the others.  
[Page 199, Line 49] 57. And when the son of Mary was cited as an 
[Page 199, Line 50] example, your people opposed.  
[Page 199, Line 51] 58. They said, “Are our gods better, or he?” 
[Page 199, Line 52] They cited him only for argument. In fact, they are a quarrelsome people.  
[Page 199, Line 53] 59. He was just a servant whom We blessed, 
[Page 199, Line 54] and We made him an example for the Chil-dren of Israel.  
[Page 199, Line 55] 60. Had We willed, We would have made of 
[Page 199, Line 56] you angels to be successors on earth.  
[Page 199, Line 57] 61. He is a porte nt of the Hour, so have no 
[Page 199, Line 58] doubt about it, and follow Me. This is a straight way.  
[Page 199, Line 59] 62. And let not Satan divert you. He is an open 
[Page 199, Line 60] enemy to you.  
[Page 199, Line 61] 63. When Jesus came with the clarifications, he 
[Page 199, Line 62] said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and 
[Page 199, Line 63] to clarify for you so me of what you differ 
[Page 199, Line 64] about. So fear Allah, and obey me.  
[Page 199, Line 65] 64. Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-
[Page 199, Line 66] ship Him —this is a straight path.”  
[Page 199, Line 67] 65. But the factions differed among them-
[Page 199, Line 68] selves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the 
[Page 199, Line 69] suffering of a painful Day.  
[Page 199, Line 70] 66. Are they  only waiting for the Hour to come 
[Page 199, Line 71] upon them suddenly, while they are una-
[Page 199, Line 72] ware?  
[Page 199, Line 73] 67. On that Day, friends will be enemies of one 
[Page 199, Line 74] another, except for the righteous.  
[Page 199, Line 75] 68. O My servants, you have nothing to fear on 
[Page 199, Line 76] that Day, nor will you grieve.  
[Page 199, Line 77] 69. Those who be lieved in Our revelations, 
[Page 199, Line 78] and were submissive.  
[Page 199, Line 79] 70. Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, 
[Page 199, Line 80] Joyfully.  
[Page 199, Line 81] 188 
[Page 200, Line 1] 44.  SMOKE   (ad-Dukhan)  
[Page 200, Line 2] 71. They will be served around with trays of 
[Page 200, Line 3] gold, and cups. Therein is whatever the souls 
[Page 200, Line 4] desire and delights the eyes. Therein you will 
[Page 200, Line 5] stay forever.  
[Page 200, Line 6] 72. Such is the Garden you are made to inherit, 
[Page 200, Line 7] because of what you used to do.  
[Page 200, Line 8] 73. Therein you will have abundant fruit, from 
[Page 200, Line 9] which you eat.  
[Page 200, Line 10] 74. As for the sinners, they will be in the tor-
[Page 200, Line 11] ment of Hell forever.  
[Page 200, Line 12] 75. It will never be eased for them. In it, the y 
[Page 200, Line 13] will be devastated.  
[Page 200, Line 14] 76. We did them no injustice, but it was they 
[Page 200, Line 15] who were the unjust.  
[Page 200, Line 16] 77. And they will cry, “O Malek, let your Lord 
[Page 200, Line 17] finish us off.” He will say, “You are staying.”  
[Page 200, Line 18] 78. We have given you the truth, but most of 
[Page 200, Line 19] you hate the truth.  
[Page 200, Line 20] 79. Have they contrived some scheme? We too 
[Page 200, Line 21] are contriving.  
[Page 200, Line 22] 80. Or do they think that We cannot hear their 
[Page 200, Line 23] secrets and their conspiracies? Yes indeed, Our messengers are by them, writing down.  
[Page 200, Line 24] 81. Say, “If the Most Gracious had a son, I 
[Page 200, Line 25] would be the first to w orship.”  
[Page 200, Line 26] 82. Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and 
[Page 200, Line 27] the earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe.  
[Page 200, Line 28] 83. So leave them to blunder and play, until 
[Page 200, Line 29] they encounter their Day which they are promised.  
[Page 200, Line 30] 84. It is He who is Allah in heaven, and Alla h 
[Page 200, Line 31] on earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.  
[Page 200, Line 32] 85. And blessed is He Who has sovereignty 
[Page 200, Line 33] over the heavens and the earth and what is 
[Page 200, Line 34] between them. He alone has knowledge of the 
[Page 200, Line 35] Hour, and to Him you will be returned.  
[Page 200, Line 36] 86. Those they invoke besides Him are incapa-
[Page 200, Line 37] ble of intercession; only those who testify to 
[Page 200, Line 38] the truth and have knowledge.  
[Page 200, Line 39] 87. And if you asked them, “Who created 
[Page 200, Line 40] them?”, they would say, “Allah.” Why then 
[Page 200, Line 41] do they deviate?  88. As for his statement: “My Lord, these are a 
[Page 200, Line 42] people who do not believe.”  
[Page 200, Line 43] 89. Pard on them, and say, “Peace.” They will 
[Page 200, Line 44] come to know.  

[Page 200, Line 46] 44. SMOKE  
[Page 200, Line 47] (ad-Dukhan ) 
[Page 200, Line 48] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 200, Line 49] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 200, Line 50] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 200, Line 51] 2. By the Enlightening Scripture.  
[Page 200, Line 52] 3. We have revealed it on a Blessed Night —
[Page 200, Line 53] We have warned.  
[Page 200, Line 54] 4. In it is distinguished every wise command.  
[Page 200, Line 55] 5. A decree from Us. We have been sending 
[Page 200, Line 56] messages.  
[Page 200, Line 57] 6. As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, 
[Page 200, Line 58] the Knower.  
[Page 200, Line 59] 7. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what 
[Page 200, Line 60] is between them, if you know for sure.  
[Page 200, Line 61] 8. There is no god but He. He gives life and 
[Page 200, Line 62] causes death —your Lord and Lord of your 
[Page 200, Line 63] ancestors of old.  
[Page 200, Line 64] 9. Yet they play around in doubt.  
[Page 200, Line 65] 10. So watch out for the Day when the sky pro-
[Page 200, Line 66] duces a visible smoke.  
[Page 200, Line 67] 11. Enveloping mankind; this is a painful pun-
[Page 200, Line 68] ishment.  
[Page 200, Line 69] 12. “Our Lord, lift the torment from us, we are 
[Page 200, Line 70] believers.”  
[Page 200, Line 71] 13. But how can they be reminded? An enlight-
[Page 200, Line 72] ening messenger has already come to them.  
[Page 200, Line 73] 14. But they turned away from him, and said, 
[Page 200, Line 74] “Educated, but crazy!”  
[Page 200, Line 75] 15. We will ease the punishment a little, but 
[Page 200, Line 76] you will revert.  
[Page 200, Line 77] 16. The Day when  We launch the Great As-
[Page 200, Line 78] sault —We will avenge.  
[Page 200, Line 79] 17. Before them We tested the people of Phar-
[Page 200, Line 80] aoh; a noble messenger came to them.  
[Page 200, Line 81] 189 
[Page 201, Line 1] 45.  KNEELING   (al-Jathiyah)  
[Page 201, Line 2] 18. Saying, “Hand over Allah’s servants to me. 
[Page 201, Line 3] I am an honest messenger to you.”  
[Page 201, Line 4] 19. And, “Do not exalt yourselves above Allah. 
[Page 201, Line 5] I come to you with clear authority.  
[Page 201, Line 6] 20. I have taken refuge in my Lord and your 
[Page 201, Line 7] Lord, lest you stone me.  
[Page 201, Line 8] 21. But if you do not believe in me, keep away 
[Page 201, Line 9] from me.”  
[Page 201, Line 10] 22. He appealed to his Lord: “These are a sinful 
[Page 201, Line 11] people.”  
[Page 201, Line 12] 23. “Set out with My servants by night— you 
[Page 201, Line 13] will be followed.  
[Page 201, Line 14] 24. And cross the sea quickly; they are an army 
[Page 201, Line 15] to be drowned.”  
[Page 201, Line 16] 25. How many gardens and fountains did they 
[Page 201, Line 17] leave behind?  
[Page 201, Line 18] 26. And plantations, and splendid buildings.  
[Page 201, Line 19] 27. And comforts they used to enjoy.  
[Page 201, Line 20] 28. So it was; and We passed it on to another 
[Page 201, Line 21] people.  
[Page 201, Line 22] 29. Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, 
[Page 201, Line 23] nor were they reprieved.  
[Page 201, Line 24] 30. And We delivered the Children of Israel 
[Page 201, Line 25] from the humiliating persecution.  
[Page 201, Line 26] 31. From Pharaoh. He was a transgressing ty-
[Page 201, Line 27] rant.  
[Page 201, Line 28] 32. And We chose them knowingly over all 
[Page 201, Line 29] other people.  
[Page 201, Line 30] 33. And We gave them many signs, in which 
[Page 201, Line 31] was an obvious test.  
[Page 201, Line 32] 34. These people say.  
[Page 201, Line 33] 35. “There is nothing but our first death, and 
[Page 201, Line 34] we will not be resurrected.  
[Page 201, Line 35] 36. Bring back our ancestors, if you are truth-
[Page 201, Line 36] ful.”  
[Page 201, Line 37] 37. Are they better, or the people of Tubba and 
[Page 201, Line 38] those before them? We annihilated them. 
[Page 201, Line 39] They were evildoers.  
[Page 201, Line 40] 38. We did not create the heavens and the 
[Page 201, Line 41] earth and what is between them to play.  39. We created them only for a specific pur-
[Page 201, Line 42] pose, but most of them do not know.  
[Page 201, Line 43] 40. The Day of Sorting Out is the appointed 
[Page 201, Line 44] time for them all.  
[Page 201, Line 45] 41. The Day when no friend will avail a friend 
[Page 201, Line 46] in any way, and they will not be helped.  
[Page 201, Line 47] 42. Except for him upon whom Allah has 
[Page 201, Line 48] mercy. He is the Mighty, the Merciful.  
[Page 201, Line 49] 43. The Tree of Bitterness.  
[Page 201, Line 50] 44. The food of the sinner.  
[Page 201, Line 51] 45. Like molten lead; boiling inside the bellies.  
[Page 201, Line 52] 46. Like the boiling of seething water.  
[Page 201, Line 53] 47. Seize him and drag him into the midst of 
[Page 201, Line 54] Hell!  
[Page 201, Line 55] 48. Then pour over his head the suffering of 
[Page 201, Line 56] the Inferno!  
[Page 201, Line 57] 49. Taste! You who were powerful an d noble.  
[Page 201, Line 58] 50. This is what you used to doubt.  
[Page 201, Line 59] 51. As for the righteous, they will be in a secure 
[Page 201, Line 60] place.  
[Page 201, Line 61] 52. Amidst gardens and springs.  
[Page 201, Line 62] 53. Dressed in silk and brocade, facing one an-
[Page 201, Line 63] other.  
[Page 201, Line 64] 54. So it is, and We will wed them to lovely 
[Page 201, Line 65] companions.  
[Page 201, Line 66] 55. They wi ll call therein for every kind of fruit, 
[Page 201, Line 67] in peace and security.  
[Page 201, Line 68] 56. Therein they will not taste death, beyond 
[Page 201, Line 69] the first death; and He will protect them from the torment of Hell.  
[Page 201, Line 70] 57. A favor from your Lord. That is the su-
[Page 201, Line 71] preme salvation.  
[Page 201, Line 72] 58. We made it easy  in your language, so that 
[Page 201, Line 73] they may remember.  
[Page 201, Line 74] 59. So wait and watch. They too are waiting 
[Page 201, Line 75] and watching.  

[Page 201, Line 77] 45. KNEELING  
[Page 201, Line 78] (al-Jathiyah ) 
[Page 201, Line 79] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 201, Line 80] 190 
[Page 202, Line 1] 45.  KNEELING   (al-Jathiyah)  
[Page 202, Line 2] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 202, Line 3] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 202, Line 4] 2. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, 
[Page 202, Line 5] the Exalted in Might, the Wise.  
[Page 202, Line 6] 3. In the heavens and the earth are proofs for 
[Page 202, Line 7] the believers.  
[Page 202, Line 8] 4. And in your own creation, and in the crea-
[Page 202, Line 9] tures He scattered, are signs for people of 
[Page 202, Line 10] firm faith.  
[Page 202, Line 11] 5. And in the alternation of night and day, and 
[Page 202, Line 12] in the sustenance Allah sends  down from the 
[Page 202, Line 13] sky, with which He revives the earth after its 
[Page 202, Line 14] death, and in the circulation of the winds, are 
[Page 202, Line 15] marvels for people who reason.  
[Page 202, Line 16] 6. These are Allah’s Verses which We recite to 
[Page 202, Line 17] you in truth. In which message, after Allah 
[Page 202, Line 18] and His revelations, wil l they believe?  
[Page 202, Line 19] 7. Woe to every sinful liar.  
[Page 202, Line 20] 8. Who hears Allah's revelations being recited 
[Page 202, Line 21] to him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though he did not hear them. Announce to him a 
[Page 202, Line 22] painful punishment.  
[Page 202, Line 23] 9. And when he learns something of Our rev-
[Page 202, Line 24] elations, he tak es them in mockery. For such 
[Page 202, Line 25] there is a shameful punishment.  
[Page 202, Line 26] 10. Beyond them lies Hell. What they have 
[Page 202, Line 27] earned will not benefit them at all, nor will 
[Page 202, Line 28] those they adopted as lords instead of Allah. 
[Page 202, Line 29] They will have a terrible punishment.  
[Page 202, Line 30] 11. This is guidance. T hose who blaspheme 
[Page 202, Line 31] their Lord’s revelations will have a punish-ment of agonizing pain.  
[Page 202, Line 32] 12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser-
[Page 202, Line 33] vice, so that ships may run through it by His 
[Page 202, Line 34] command, and that you may seek of His 
[Page 202, Line 35] bounty, and that you may give thanks.  
[Page 202, Line 36] 13. And He placed at your service whatever is 
[Page 202, Line 37] in the heavens and whatever is on earth —all 
[Page 202, Line 38] is from Him. In that are signs for a people who think.  
[Page 202, Line 39] 14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who 
[Page 202, Line 40] do not hope for the Days of Allah. He will fully recompense peop le for whatever they 
[Page 202, Line 41] have earned.  
[Page 202, Line 42] 15. Whoever does a good deed, it is for his soul; 
[Page 202, Line 43] and whoever commits evil, it is against it; then to your Lord you will be returned.  
[Page 202, Line 44] 16. We gave the Children of Israel the Book, 
[Page 202, Line 45] and wisdom, and prophecy; and We pro-
[Page 202, Line 46] vided t hem with the good things; and We 
[Page 202, Line 47] gave them advantage over all other people.  
[Page 202, Line 48] 17. And We gave them precise rulings. They 
[Page 202, Line 49] fell into dispute only after knowledge came to them, out of mutual rivalry. Your Lord will 
[Page 202, Line 50] judge between them on the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 202, Line 51] tion regarding the things they differed about.  
[Page 202, Line 52] 18. Then We set you upon a pathway of faith, 
[Page 202, Line 53] so follow it, and do not follow the inclina-
[Page 202, Line 54] tions of those who do not know.  
[Page 202, Line 55] 19. They will not help you against Allah in any 
[Page 202, Line 56] way. The wrongdoers are allies of one an-
[Page 202, Line 57] other,  while Allah is the Protector of the 
[Page 202, Line 58] righteous.  
[Page 202, Line 59] 20. This is an illumination for mankind, and 
[Page 202, Line 60] guidance, and mercy for people who believe 
[Page 202, Line 61] with certainty.  
[Page 202, Line 62] 21. Do those who perpetrate the evil deeds as-
[Page 202, Line 63] sume that We will regard them as equal to those who believe  and do righteous deeds, 
[Page 202, Line 64] whether in their life or their death? Evil is 
[Page 202, Line 65] their judgment!  
[Page 202, Line 66] 22. Allah created the heavens and the earth 
[Page 202, Line 67] with justice, so that every soul will be repaid 
[Page 202, Line 68] for what it has earned. And they will not be wronged.  
[Page 202, Line 69] 23. Have you considered  him who has taken 
[Page 202, Line 70] his desire for his god? Allah has knowingly 
[Page 202, Line 71] led him astray, and has sealed his hearing and 
[Page 202, Line 72] his heart, and has placed a veil over his vision. 
[Page 202, Line 73] Who will guide him after Allah? Will you not 
[Page 202, Line 74] reflect?  
[Page 202, Line 75] 24. And they say, “There is nothing but this 
[Page 202, Line 76] our present life; we die and we live, and noth-
[Page 202, Line 77] ing destroys us except time.” But they have no 
[Page 202, Line 78] knowledge of that; they are only guessing.  
[Page 202, Line 79] 191 
[Page 203, Line 1] 46.  THE DUNES   (al-Ahqaf)  
[Page 203, Line 2] 25. When Our clarifying Verses are recited to 
[Page 203, Line 3] them, their only argument is to say, “Bring 
[Page 203, Line 4] back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”  
[Page 203, Line 5] 26. Say, “Allah gives you life, then He makes 
[Page 203, Line 6] you die; then He gathers you for the Day of 
[Page 203, Line 7] Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. 
[Page 203, Line 8] But most people do not know.”  
[Page 203, Line 9] 27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav-
[Page 203, Line 10] ens and the earth. On the Day w hen the Hour 
[Page 203, Line 11] takes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.  
[Page 203, Line 12] 28. You will see every community on its knees; 
[Page 203, Line 13] every community will be called to its Book: “Today you are being repaid for what you 
[Page 203, Line 14] used to do.  
[Page 203, Line 15] 29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in 
[Page 203, Line 16] truth.  We have been transcribing what you 
[Page 203, Line 17] have been doing.”  
[Page 203, Line 18] 30. As for those who believed and did right-
[Page 203, Line 19] eous deeds, their Lord will admit them into 
[Page 203, Line 20] His mercy. That is the clear triumph.  
[Page 203, Line 21] 31. But as for those who disbelieved: “Were My 
[Page 203, Line 22] revelations not recited to you? But you 
[Page 203, Line 23] turned arrogant, and were guilty people.”  
[Page 203, Line 24] 32. And when it was said, “The promise of Al-
[Page 203, Line 25] lah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,” 
[Page 203, Line 26] you said, “We do not know what the Hour is; we think it is only speculation; we are not 
[Page 203, Line 27] convinced.”  
[Page 203, Line 28] 33. The evils of what they did will become evi-
[Page 203, Line 29] dent to them, and the very thing they ridi-
[Page 203, Line 30] culed will haunt them.  
[Page 203, Line 31] 34. And it will be said, “Today We forget you, 
[Page 203, Line 32] as you forgot the encounter of this Day of 
[Page 203, Line 33] yours. Your abode is the Fire, and there are 
[Page 203, Line 34] no saviors for you . 
[Page 203, Line 35] 35. That is because you took Allah’s revela-
[Page 203, Line 36] tions for a joke, and the worldly life lured 
[Page 203, Line 37] you.” So today they will not be brought out of 
[Page 203, Line 38] it, and they will not be allowed to repent.  
[Page 203, Line 39] 36. Praise belongs to Allah; Lord of the heav-
[Page 203, Line 40] ens, Lord of the earth, Lord of humanity.  
[Page 203, Line 41] 37. To Him belongs all supremacy in the heav-
[Page 203, Line 42] ens and the earth. He is the Majestic, the 
[Page 203, Line 43] Wise.    
[Page 203, Line 44] 46. THE DUNES  
[Page 203, Line 45] (al-Ahqaf ) 
[Page 203, Line 46] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 203, Line 47] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 203, Line 48] 1. Ha, Meem.  
[Page 203, Line 49] 2. The sending down of the Scripture is from 
[Page 203, Line 50] Allah, the Honorable, the Wise.  
[Page 203, Line 51] 3. We did not create the heavens and the earth 
[Page 203, Line 52] and what lies between them except with rea-
[Page 203, Line 53] son, and for a finite period. But the blas-
[Page 203, Line 54] phemers continue to ignore the warnings 
[Page 203, Line 55] they receive.  
[Page 203, Line 56] 4. Say, “Have you considered those you wor-
[Page 203, Line 57] ship ins tead of Allah? Show me which por-
[Page 203, Line 58] tion of the earth they have created. Or do they 
[Page 203, Line 59] own a share of the heavens? Bring me a scrip-
[Page 203, Line 60] ture prior to this one, or some trace of 
[Page 203, Line 61] knowledge, if you are truthful.” 
[Page 203, Line 62] 5. Who is more wrong than him who invokes, 
[Page 203, Line 63] besides Allah, those who will not answer him 
[Page 203, Line 64] until the Day of Resurrection, and are heed-less of their prayers?  
[Page 203, Line 65] 6. And when humanity is gathered, they will 
[Page 203, Line 66] be enemies to them, and will renounce their 
[Page 203, Line 67] worship of them.  
[Page 203, Line 68] 7. When Our revelations are recited to them, 
[Page 203, Line 69] plain and clear, those who disbelieve say of 
[Page 203, Line 70] the truth when it has come to them, “This is 
[Page 203, Line 71] obviously magic.”  
[Page 203, Line 72] 8. Or do they say, “He invented it himself”? 
[Page 203, Line 73] Say, “If I invented it myself, there is nothing 
[Page 203, Line 74] you can do to protect me from Allah. He 
[Page 203, Line 75] knows well what you are e ngaged in. He is 
[Page 203, Line 76] sufficient witness between me and you. He is 
[Page 203, Line 77] the Forgiver, the Merciful.”  
[Page 203, Line 78] 9. Say, “I am not different from the other mes-
[Page 203, Line 79] sengers; and I do not know what will be done 
[Page 203, Line 80] with me, or with you. I only follow what is in-
[Page 203, Line 81] spired in me, and I am only a clear warner.”  
[Page 203, Line 82] 10. Say, “Have you considered? What if it is 
[Page 203, Line 83] from Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness 
[Page 203, Line 84] from the Children of Israel testified to its like, 
[Page 203, Line 85] 192 
[Page 204, Line 1] 46.  THE DUNES   (al-Ahqaf)  
[Page 204, Line 2] and has believed, while you turned arrogant. 
[Page 204, Line 3] Allah does not guide the unjust people.”  
[Page 204, Line 4] 11. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-
[Page 204, Line 5] lieve, “If it were anything good, they would 
[Page 204, Line 6] not have preceded us to it.” And since they 
[Page 204, Line 7] were not guided by it, they will say, “This is an ancient lie.”  
[Page 204, Line 8] 12. And before it was the Book of Moses, a 
[Page 204, Line 9] model and a mercy. And thi s is a confirming 
[Page 204, Line 10] Book, in the Arabic language, to warn those 
[Page 204, Line 11] who do wrong —and good news for the doers 
[Page 204, Line 12] of good.  
[Page 204, Line 13] 13. Those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” then 
[Page 204, Line 14] lead a righteous life —they have nothing to 
[Page 204, Line 15] fear, nor shall they grieve.  
[Page 204, Line 16] 14. These are the inhabitan ts of Paradise, 
[Page 204, Line 17] where they will dwell forever —a reward for 
[Page 204, Line 18] what they used to do.  
[Page 204, Line 19] 15. We have enjoined upon man kindness to 
[Page 204, Line 20] his parents. His mother carried him with dif-
[Page 204, Line 21] ficulty, and delivered him with difficulty. His bearing and weaning takes thirty months. 
[Page 204, Line 22] Until, when he has attained his maturity, and has reached forty years, he says, “Lord, enable 
[Page 204, Line 23] me to appreciate the blessings You have be-
[Page 204, Line 24] stowed upon me and upon my parents, and 
[Page 204, Line 25] to act with righteousness, pleasing You. And 
[Page 204, Line 26] improve my children for me. I have sincerely 
[Page 204, Line 27] repented to You, and I am of those who have 
[Page 204, Line 28] surrendered.”  
[Page 204, Line 29] 16. Those are they from whom We accept the 
[Page 204, Line 30] best of their deeds, and We overlook their 
[Page 204, Line 31] misdeeds, among the dwellers of Paradise —
[Page 204, Line 32] the promise of truth which they are prom-
[Page 204, Line 33] ised.  
[Page 204, Line 34] 17. As for him who says to his parents, 
[Page 204, Line 35] “Enough of you! Are you promising me that 
[Page 204, Line 36] I will be raised up, when generations have passed away before me?” While they cry for 
[Page 204, Line 37] Allah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe! The 
[Page 204, Line 38] promise of Allah is true!” But he says, “These 
[Page 204, Line 39] are nothing but tales of the ancients.”  
[Page 204, Line 40] 18. Those are they upon whom the sentence is 
[Page 204, Line 41] justified, among the communities that have 
[Page 204, Line 42] passed away before them, of jinn and hu-
[Page 204, Line 43] mans. They are truly losers.  19. There are degrees for everyone, according 
[Page 204, Line 44] to what they have done, and He  will repay 
[Page 204, Line 45] them for their works in full, and they will not be wronged.  
[Page 204, Line 46] 20. On the Day when the faithless will be pa-
[Page 204, Line 47] raded before the Fire: “You have squandered 
[Page 204, Line 48] your good in your worldly life, and you took 
[Page 204, Line 49] pleasure in them. So today you are being re-
[Page 204, Line 50] paid wit h the torment of shame, because of 
[Page 204, Line 51] your unjust arrogance on earth, and because 
[Page 204, Line 52] you used to sin.”  
[Page 204, Line 53] 21. And mention the brother of Aad, as he 
[Page 204, Line 54] warned his people at the dunes. Warnings 
[Page 204, Line 55] have passed away before him, and after him: 
[Page 204, Line 56] “Worship none but Allah; I fear for you the 
[Page 204, Line 57] punishment of a tremendous Day.”  
[Page 204, Line 58] 22. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us 
[Page 204, Line 59] from our gods? Then bring us what you 
[Page 204, Line 60] threaten us with, if you are being truthful.”  
[Page 204, Line 61] 23. He said, “The knowledge is only with Al-
[Page 204, Line 62] lah, and I inform you of what I was sent with; 
[Page 204, Line 63] but I see you are an ignorant people.”  
[Page 204, Line 64] 24. Then, when they saw a cloud approaching 
[Page 204, Line 65] their valley, they said, “This is a cloud that 
[Page 204, Line 66] will bring us rain.” “In fact, it is what you 
[Page 204, Line 67] were impatient for: a wind in which is griev-
[Page 204, Line 68] ous suffering.”  
[Page 204, Line 69] 25. It wi ll destroy everything by the command 
[Page 204, Line 70] of its Lord. And when the morning came 
[Page 204, Line 71] upon them, there was nothing to be seen ex-
[Page 204, Line 72] cept their dwellings. Thus We requite the 
[Page 204, Line 73] guilty people.  
[Page 204, Line 74] 26. We had empowered them in the same way 
[Page 204, Line 75] as We empowered you; and We gave them 
[Page 204, Line 76] the hearing, and the sight, and the minds. But 
[Page 204, Line 77] neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor 
[Page 204, Line 78] their minds availed them in any way. That is 
[Page 204, Line 79] because they disregarded the revelations of 
[Page 204, Line 80] Allah; and so they became surrounded by 
[Page 204, Line 81] what they used to ridicule.  
[Page 204, Line 82] 27. We ha ve destroyed many townships 
[Page 204, Line 83] around you, and diversified the signs, so that 
[Page 204, Line 84] they may return.  
[Page 204, Line 85] 28. Why then did the idols, whom they wor-
[Page 204, Line 86] shiped as means of nearness to Allah, not 
[Page 204, Line 87] help them? In fact, they abandoned them. It 
[Page 204, Line 88] 193 
[Page 205, Line 1] 47.  MUHAMMAD   (Muhammad)  
[Page 205, Line 2] was their lie, a fabrication of their  own mak-
[Page 205, Line 3] ing. 
[Page 205, Line 4] 29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a 
[Page 205, Line 5] number of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When 
[Page 205, Line 6] they came in its presence, they said, “Pay at-
[Page 205, Line 7] tention!” Then, when it was concluded, they rushed to their people, warning them.  
[Page 205, Line 8] 30. They said, “O our peopl e, we have heard a 
[Page 205, Line 9] Scripture, sent down after Moses, confirming 
[Page 205, Line 10] what came before it. It guides to the truth, 
[Page 205, Line 11] and to a straight path.  
[Page 205, Line 12] 31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah, 
[Page 205, Line 13] and believe in Him; and He will forgive you 
[Page 205, Line 14] your sins, and will save you from  a painful 
[Page 205, Line 15] punishment.”  
[Page 205, Line 16] 32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah 
[Page 205, Line 17] will not escape on earth, and has no protec-
[Page 205, Line 18] tors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.  
[Page 205, Line 19] 33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created 
[Page 205, Line 20] the heavens and the earth, and was never 
[Page 205, Line 21] tired b y creating them, is Able to revive the 
[Page 205, Line 22] dead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every-
[Page 205, Line 23] thing.  
[Page 205, Line 24] 34. On the Day when those who disbelieved 
[Page 205, Line 25] are presented to the Fire: “Is this not real?” They will say, “Yes, indeed, by our Lord.” He 
[Page 205, Line 26] will say, “Then taste the suffering  for having 
[Page 205, Line 27] disbelieved.”  
[Page 205, Line 28] 35. So be patient, as the messengers with re-
[Page 205, Line 29] solve were patient, and do not be hasty re-
[Page 205, Line 30] garding them. On the Day when they witness 
[Page 205, Line 31] what they are promised, it will seem as if they 
[Page 205, Line 32] had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc-
[Page 205, Line 33] lamation:  Will any be destroyed except the 
[Page 205, Line 34] sinful people?  

[Page 205, Line 36] 47. MUHAMMAD  
[Page 205, Line 37] (Muhammad ) 
[Page 205, Line 38] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 205, Line 39] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 205, Line 40] 1. Those who disbelieve and repel from the 
[Page 205, Line 41] path of Allah— He nullifies their works.  
[Page 205, Line 42] 2. While those who believe, and work right-
[Page 205, Line 43] eousness, and believe in what was sent down to Muhammad —and it is the truth from their 
[Page 205, Line 44] Lord —He remits their sins, and relieves their 
[Page 205, Line 45] concerns.  
[Page 205, Line 46] 3. That is because those who disbelieve follow 
[Page 205, Line 47] falsehoods, while those who believe follow 
[Page 205, Line 48] the truth from the ir Lord. Allah thus cites for 
[Page 205, Line 49] the people their examples.  
[Page 205, Line 50] 4. When you encounter those who disbelieve, 
[Page 205, Line 51] strike at their necks. Then, when you have routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either 
[Page 205, Line 52] release them by grace, or by ransom, until 
[Page 205, Line 53] war lays down its burdens . Had Allah willed, 
[Page 205, Line 54] He could have defeated them Himself, but He 
[Page 205, Line 55] thus tests some of you by means of others. As 
[Page 205, Line 56] for those who are killed in the way of Allah, 
[Page 205, Line 57] He will not let their deeds go to waste.  
[Page 205, Line 58] 5. He will guide them, and will improve their 
[Page 205, Line 59] state of mind . 
[Page 205, Line 60] 6. And will admit them into Paradise, which 
[Page 205, Line 61] He has identified for them.  
[Page 205, Line 62] 7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He 
[Page 205, Line 63] will support you, and will strengthen your 
[Page 205, Line 64] foothold.  
[Page 205, Line 65] 8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is 
[Page 205, Line 66] perdition, and He will waste their  deeds.  
[Page 205, Line 67] 9. That is because they hated what Allah re-
[Page 205, Line 68] vealed, so He nullified their deeds.  
[Page 205, Line 69] 10. Have they not journeyed through the earth 
[Page 205, Line 70] and seen the consequences for those before 
[Page 205, Line 71] them? Allah poured destruction upon them, and for the unbelievers is something compa-
[Page 205, Line 72] rable.  
[Page 205, Line 73] 11. That is because Allah is the Master of those 
[Page 205, Line 74] who believe, while the disbelievers have no 
[Page 205, Line 75] master.  
[Page 205, Line 76] 12. Allah will admit those who believe and do 
[Page 205, Line 77] good deeds into gardens beneath which riv-
[Page 205, Line 78] ers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en-joy themse lves, and eat as cattle eat, and the 
[Page 205, Line 79] Fire will be their dwelling.  
[Page 205, Line 80] 13. How many a town was more powerful than 
[Page 205, Line 81] your town which evicted you? We destroyed 
[Page 205, Line 82] them, and there was no helper for them.  
[Page 205, Line 83] 14. Is he who stands upon evidence from his 
[Page 205, Line 84] Lord, like someone whose evil deed is made 
[Page 205, Line 85] 194 
[Page 206, Line 1] 47.  MUHAMMAD   (Muhammad)  
[Page 206, Line 2] to appear good to him? And they follow their 
[Page 206, Line 3] own desires?  
[Page 206, Line 4] 15. The likeness of the Garden promised to the 
[Page 206, Line 5] righteous: in it are rivers of pure water, and 
[Page 206, Line 6] rivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine 
[Page 206, Line 7] delightful to the drinkers, and r ivers of 
[Page 206, Line 8] strained honey. And therein they will have of every fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. Like one abiding in the Fire forever, and are 
[Page 206, Line 9] given to drink boiling water, that cuts -up 
[Page 206, Line 10] their bowels?  
[Page 206, Line 11] 16. Among them are those who listen to you, 
[Page 206, Line 12] but when  they leave your presence, they say 
[Page 206, Line 13] to those given knowledge, “What did he say 
[Page 206, Line 14] just now?” Those are they whose hearts Allah 
[Page 206, Line 15] has sealed, and they follow their own desires.  
[Page 206, Line 16] 17. As for those who are guided, He increases 
[Page 206, Line 17] them in guidance, and He has granted th em 
[Page 206, Line 18] their righteousness.  
[Page 206, Line 19] 18. Are they just waiting until the Hour comes 
[Page 206, Line 20] to them suddenly? Its tokens have already 
[Page 206, Line 21] come. But how will they be reminded when it 
[Page 206, Line 22] has come to them?  
[Page 206, Line 23] 19. Know that there is no god but Allah, and 
[Page 206, Line 24] ask forgiveness for your sin, and fo r the be-
[Page 206, Line 25] lieving men and believing women. Allah 
[Page 206, Line 26] knows your movements, and your resting -
[Page 206, Line 27] place.  
[Page 206, Line 28] 20. Those who believe say, “If only a chapter is 
[Page 206, Line 29] sent down.” Yet when a decisive chapter is sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those in whose hear ts is sickness 
[Page 206, Line 30] looking at you with the look of someone 
[Page 206, Line 31] fainting at death. So woe to them!  
[Page 206, Line 32] 21. Obedience and upright speech. Then, 
[Page 206, Line 33] when the matter is settled, being true to Allah 
[Page 206, Line 34] would have been better for them.  
[Page 206, Line 35] 22. If you turn away, you are likely to make 
[Page 206, Line 36] mischief on earth, and sever your family ties.  
[Page 206, Line 37] 23. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. He 
[Page 206, Line 38] made them deaf, and blinded their sight.  
[Page 206, Line 39] 24. Will they not ponder the Quran? Or are 
[Page 206, Line 40] there locks upon their hearts?  25. Those who reverted after the guidance be-
[Page 206, Line 41] came clear to them —Satan has enticed them, 
[Page 206, Line 42] and has given them latitude.  
[Page 206, Line 43] 26. That is because they said to those who 
[Page 206, Line 44] hated what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in certain matters.” But Allah knows 
[Page 206, Line 45] their secret thoughts.  
[Page 206, Line 46] 27. How about when the angels take t hem at 
[Page 206, Line 47] death, beating their faces and their backs?  
[Page 206, Line 48] 28. That is because they pursued what dis-
[Page 206, Line 49] pleases Allah, and they disliked His approval, 
[Page 206, Line 50] so He nullified their works.  
[Page 206, Line 51] 29. Do those in whose hearts is sickness think 
[Page 206, Line 52] that Allah will not expose their malice?  
[Page 206, Line 53] 30. Had We willed, We could have shown 
[Page 206, Line 54] them to you, and you would have recognized 
[Page 206, Line 55] them by their marks. Yet you will recognize 
[Page 206, Line 56] them by their tone of speech. And Allah 
[Page 206, Line 57] knows your actions.  
[Page 206, Line 58] 31. We will certainly test you, until We know 
[Page 206, Line 59] those among you who stri ve, and those who 
[Page 206, Line 60] are steadfast, and We will test your reactions.  
[Page 206, Line 61] 32. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from the 
[Page 206, Line 62] path of Allah, and oppose the Messenger af-
[Page 206, Line 63] ter guidance has become clear to them —they 
[Page 206, Line 64] will not hurt Allah in the least, but He will 
[Page 206, Line 65] nullify their  deeds.  
[Page 206, Line 66] 33. O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey 
[Page 206, Line 67] the Messenger, and do not let your deeds go 
[Page 206, Line 68] to waste.  
[Page 206, Line 69] 34. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from Al-
[Page 206, Line 70] lah’s path, and then die as disbelievers —Al-
[Page 206, Line 71] lah will not forgive them.  
[Page 206, Line 72] 35. So do not waver and call for pea ce while 
[Page 206, Line 73] you have the upper hand. Allah is with you, 
[Page 206, Line 74] and He will not waste your efforts.  
[Page 206, Line 75] 36. The life of this world is nothing but play 
[Page 206, Line 76] and pastime. But if you have faith and lead a 
[Page 206, Line 77] righteous life, He will grant you your re-wards, and He will not ask you fo r your pos-
[Page 206, Line 78] sessions.  
[Page 206, Line 79] 37. Were He to ask you for it, and press you, 
[Page 206, Line 80] you would become tightfisted, and He would 
[Page 206, Line 81] expose your unwillingness.  
[Page 206, Line 82] 195 
[Page 207, Line 1] 48.  VICTORY   (al-Fath)  
[Page 207, Line 2] 38. Here you are, being called to spend in the 
[Page 207, Line 3] cause of Allah. Among you are those who 
[Page 207, Line 4] withhold; but whoever withholds is with-
[Page 207, Line 5] holding against his own soul. Allah is the 
[Page 207, Line 6] Rich, while you are the needy. And if you 
[Page 207, Line 7] turn away, He will replace you with another 
[Page 207, Line 8] people, and they will not be like you.  

[Page 207, Line 10] 48. VICTORY  
[Page 207, Line 11] (al-Fath ) 
[Page 207, Line 12] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 207, Line 13] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 207, Line 14] 1. We ha ve granted you a conspicuous victory.  
[Page 207, Line 15] 2. That Allah may forgive you your sin, past 
[Page 207, Line 16] and to come, and complete His favors upon you, and guide you in a straight path.  
[Page 207, Line 17] 3. And help you with an unwavering support.  
[Page 207, Line 18] 4. It is He who sent down tranquility into the 
[Page 207, Line 19] hearts of the believers, to add faith to their 
[Page 207, Line 20] faith. To Allah belong the forces of the heav-
[Page 207, Line 21] ens and the earth. Allah is Knowing and 
[Page 207, Line 22] Wise.  
[Page 207, Line 23] 5. He will admit the believers, male and fe-
[Page 207, Line 24] male, into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever, and He will re-
[Page 207, Line 25] mit their sins. That, with Allah, is a great tri-
[Page 207, Line 26] umph.  
[Page 207, Line 27] 6. And He will punish the hypocrites, male 
[Page 207, Line 28] and female, and the idolaters, male and fe-
[Page 207, Line 29] male, those who harbor evil thoughts about 
[Page 207, Line 30] Allah. They are surrounded by evil; and Allah 
[Page 207, Line 31] is angry with the m, and has cursed them, and 
[Page 207, Line 32] has prepared for them Hell —a miserable des-
[Page 207, Line 33] tination.  
[Page 207, Line 34] 7. To Allah belong the troops of the heavens 
[Page 207, Line 35] and the earth. Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 207, Line 36] 8. We sent you as a witness, and a bearer of 
[Page 207, Line 37] good news, and a warner.  
[Page 207, Line 38] 9. That you may beli eve in Allah and His Mes-
[Page 207, Line 39] senger, and support Him, and honor Him, 
[Page 207, Line 40] and praise Him morning and evening.  
[Page 207, Line 41] 10. Those who pledge allegiance to you are 
[Page 207, Line 42] pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Al-
[Page 207, Line 43] lah is over their hands. Whoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will grant him a great reward.  
[Page 207, Line 44] 11. The Desert -Arabs who remained behind 
[Page 207, Line 45] will say to you, “Our belongings and our fam-
[Page 207, Line 46] ilies have preoccupied us, so ask forgiveness 
[Page 207, Line 47] for us.” They say with their tongues  what is 
[Page 207, Line 48] not in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you 
[Page 207, Line 49] anything against Allah, if He desires loss for 
[Page 207, Line 50] you, or desires gain for you?” In fact, Allah is 
[Page 207, Line 51] Informed of what you do.  
[Page 207, Line 52] 12. But you thought that the Messenger and 
[Page 207, Line 53] the believers will never return to the ir fami-
[Page 207, Line 54] lies, and this seemed fine to your hearts; and 
[Page 207, Line 55] you harbored evil thoughts, and were uncivi-
[Page 207, Line 56] lized people.  
[Page 207, Line 57] 13. He who does not believe in Allah and His 
[Page 207, Line 58] Messenger —We have prepared for the disbe-
[Page 207, Line 59] lievers a Blazing Fire.  
[Page 207, Line 60] 14. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heav-
[Page 207, Line 61] ens and the earth. He forgives whomever He 
[Page 207, Line 62] wills, and He punishes whomever He wills. 
[Page 207, Line 63] Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 207, Line 64] 15. Those who lagged behind will say when 
[Page 207, Line 65] you depart to collect the gains, “Let us follow 
[Page 207, Line 66] you.” They want to change the Word of Al-
[Page 207, Line 67] lah. Say, “You will not follow us; Allah has 
[Page 207, Line 68] said so before.” Then they will say, “But you 
[Page 207, Line 69] are jealous of us.” In fact, they understand 
[Page 207, Line 70] only a little.  
[Page 207, Line 71] 16. Say to the Desert -Arabs who lagged be-
[Page 207, Line 72] hind, “You will be called against a people of 
[Page 207, Line 73] great might; you w ill fight them, unless they 
[Page 207, Line 74] submit. If you obey, Allah will give you a fine 
[Page 207, Line 75] reward. But if you turn away, as you turned 
[Page 207, Line 76] away before, He will punish you with a pain-
[Page 207, Line 77] ful punishment.”  
[Page 207, Line 78] 17. There is no blame on the blind, nor any 
[Page 207, Line 79] blame on the lame, nor any blame  on the sick. 
[Page 207, Line 80] Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger —
[Page 207, Line 81] He will admit him into gardens beneath 
[Page 207, Line 82] which rivers flow; but whoever turns away —
[Page 207, Line 83] He will punish him with a painful punish-
[Page 207, Line 84] ment.  
[Page 207, Line 85] 18. Allah was pleased with the believers, when 
[Page 207, Line 86] they pledged allegiance to you  under the tree. 
[Page 207, Line 87] 196 
[Page 208, Line 1] 49.  THE CHAMBERS   (al-Hujurat)  
[Page 208, Line 2] He knew what was in their hearts, and sent 
[Page 208, Line 3] down serenity upon them, and rewarded 
[Page 208, Line 4] them with an imminent conquest.  
[Page 208, Line 5] 19. And abundant gains for them to capture. 
[Page 208, Line 6] Allah is Mighty and Wise.  
[Page 208, Line 7] 20. Allah has promised you abundant gains, 
[Page 208, Line 8] which you wil l capture. He has expedited this 
[Page 208, Line 9] for you, and has restrained people’s hands from you; that it may be a sign to the believ-
[Page 208, Line 10] ers, and that He may guide you on a straight 
[Page 208, Line 11] path.  
[Page 208, Line 12] 21. And other things, of which you were inca-
[Page 208, Line 13] pable, but Allah has encompassed them. A l-
[Page 208, Line 14] lah is Capable of everything.  
[Page 208, Line 15] 22. If those who disbelieve had fought you, 
[Page 208, Line 16] they would have turned back and fled, then 
[Page 208, Line 17] found neither protector nor helper.  
[Page 208, Line 18] 23. It is Allah’s pattern, ongoing since the past. 
[Page 208, Line 19] You will never find any change in Allah’s pat-
[Page 208, Line 20] tern.  
[Page 208, Line 21] 24. It is He who withheld their hands from 
[Page 208, Line 22] you, and your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after giving you advantage over 
[Page 208, Line 23] them. Allah is Observer of what you do.  
[Page 208, Line 24] 25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you 
[Page 208, Line 25] from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented t he 
[Page 208, Line 26] offering from reaching its destination. Were 
[Page 208, Line 27] it not for faithful men and faithful women, 
[Page 208, Line 28] whom you did not know, you were about to 
[Page 208, Line 29] hurt them, and became guilty of an uninten-
[Page 208, Line 30] tional crime. Thus Allah admits into His 
[Page 208, Line 31] mercy whomever He wills. Had they dis-
[Page 208, Line 32] persed, We would have punished those who 
[Page 208, Line 33] disbelieved among them with a painful pen-
[Page 208, Line 34] alty. 
[Page 208, Line 35] 26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts 
[Page 208, Line 36] with rage —the rage of the days of ignorance. 
[Page 208, Line 37] But Allah sent His serenity down upon His 
[Page 208, Line 38] Messenger, and upon the believers, and  im-
[Page 208, Line 39] posed on them the words of righteousness —
[Page 208, Line 40] of which they were most worthy and deserv-
[Page 208, Line 41] ing. Allah is aware of everything.  
[Page 208, Line 42] 27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s vision 
[Page 208, Line 43] in truth: “You will enter the Sacred Mosque, 
[Page 208, Line 44] Allah willing, in security, heads shaven, or  
[Page 208, Line 45] hair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you did not know, and has granted besides that an 
[Page 208, Line 46] imminent victory.”  
[Page 208, Line 47] 28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
[Page 208, Line 48] guidance and the religion of truth, to make it 
[Page 208, Line 49] prevail over all religions. Allah suffices as 
[Page 208, Line 50] Witnes s. 
[Page 208, Line 51] 29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. 
[Page 208, Line 52] Those with him are stern against the disbe-
[Page 208, Line 53] lievers, yet compassionate amongst them-selves. You see them kneeling, prostrating, 
[Page 208, Line 54] seeking blessings from Allah and approval. 
[Page 208, Line 55] Their marks are on their faces from the ef-
[Page 208, Line 56] fects of p rostration. Such is their description 
[Page 208, Line 57] in the Torah, and their description in the 
[Page 208, Line 58] Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes 
[Page 208, Line 59] strong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im-
[Page 208, Line 60] pressing the farmers. Through them He en-
[Page 208, Line 61] rages the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good 
[Page 208, Line 62] deeds forgiveness and a great reward.  

[Page 208, Line 64] 49. THE CHAMBERS  
[Page 208, Line 65] (al-Hujurat)  
[Page 208, Line 66] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 208, Line 67] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 208, Line 68] 1. O you who believe! Do not place your opin-
[Page 208, Line 69] ions above that of Allah and His Messenger, 
[Page 208, Line 70] and fear Al lah. Allah is Hearing and Know-
[Page 208, Line 71] ing. 
[Page 208, Line 72] 2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices 
[Page 208, Line 73] above the voice of the Prophet, and do not 
[Page 208, Line 74] speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another, lest your works be in vain with-
[Page 208, Line 75] out you realizing.  
[Page 208, Line 76] 3. Those who lower their  voices before Allah’s 
[Page 208, Line 77] Messenger —those are they whose hearts Al-
[Page 208, Line 78] lah has tested for piety. They will have for-
[Page 208, Line 79] giveness and a great reward.  
[Page 208, Line 80] 4. Those who call you from behind the cham-
[Page 208, Line 81] bers—most of them do not understand.  
[Page 208, Line 82] 5. Had they remained patient until you ca me 
[Page 208, Line 83] out to them, it would have been better for 
[Page 208, Line 84] them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 208, Line 85] 197 
[Page 209, Line 1] 50.  QAF   (Qaf)  
[Page 209, Line 2] 6. O you who believe! If a troublemaker brings 
[Page 209, Line 3] you any news, investigate, lest you harm peo-
[Page 209, Line 4] ple out of ignorance, and you become regret-
[Page 209, Line 5] ful for what you have done.  
[Page 209, Line 6] 7. And know that among you is the Messenger 
[Page 209, Line 7] of Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things, 
[Page 209, Line 8] you would have suffered hardship. But Allah 
[Page 209, Line 9] has given you the love of faith, and adorned 
[Page 209, Line 10] it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mis-
[Page 209, Line 11] chief, and rebellion hateful to you. The se are 
[Page 209, Line 12] the rightly guided.  
[Page 209, Line 13] 8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is 
[Page 209, Line 14] Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 209, Line 15] 9. If two groups of believers fight each other, 
[Page 209, Line 16] reconcile between them. But if one group ag-
[Page 209, Line 17] gresses against the other, fight the aggressing group until it complies with Allah’s com-
[Page 209, Line 18] mand. Once it has complied, reconcile be-
[Page 209, Line 19] tween them with justice, and be equitable. Al-
[Page 209, Line 20] lah loves the equitable.  
[Page 209, Line 21] 10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be-
[Page 209, Line 22] tween your brothers, and remain conscious of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.  
[Page 209, Line 23] 11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule 
[Page 209, Line 24] other people, for they may be better than 
[Page 209, Line 25] they. Nor shall any women ridicule other 
[Page 209, Line 26] women, for they may be better than they. Nor 
[Page 209, Line 27] shall you slander one another, nor shall you 
[Page 209, Line 28] insult one another with names. Evil is th e re-
[Page 209, Line 29] turn to wickedness after having attained 
[Page 209, Line 30] faith. Whoever does not repent —these are 
[Page 209, Line 31] the wrongdoers.  
[Page 209, Line 32] 12. O you who believe! Avoid most suspi-
[Page 209, Line 33] cion —some suspicion is sinful. And do not 
[Page 209, Line 34] spy on one another, nor backbite one an-
[Page 209, Line 35] other. Would any of you like to ea t the flesh 
[Page 209, Line 36] of his dead brother? You would detest it. So 
[Page 209, Line 37] remain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re-lenting, Most Merciful.  
[Page 209, Line 38] 13. O people! We created you from a male and 
[Page 209, Line 39] a female, and made you races and tribes, that 
[Page 209, Line 40] you may know one another. The best among 
[Page 209, Line 41] you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous. 
[Page 209, Line 42] Allah is All -Knowing, Well -Experienced.  
[Page 209, Line 43] 14. The Desert -Arabs say, “We have believed.” 
[Page 209, Line 44] Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered 
[Page 209, Line 45] into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and 
[Page 209, Line 46] His Messenger, He will not diminish any of 
[Page 209, Line 47] your deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”  
[Page 209, Line 48] 15. The believers are those who believe in Al-
[Page 209, Line 49] lah and His Messenger, and then have not 
[Page 209, Line 50] doubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with 
[Page 209, Line 51] their wealth and their perso ns. These are the 
[Page 209, Line 52] sincere.  
[Page 209, Line 53] 16. Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about 
[Page 209, Line 54] your religion, when Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is 
[Page 209, Line 55] aware of all things?”  
[Page 209, Line 56] 17. They regarded it a favor to you that they 
[Page 209, Line 57] have submitted. Say, “Do not c onsider your 
[Page 209, Line 58] submission a favor to me; it is Allah who has 
[Page 209, Line 59] done you a favor by guiding you to the faith, 
[Page 209, Line 60] if you are sincere.”  
[Page 209, Line 61] 18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and 
[Page 209, Line 62] the earth, and Allah is seeing of everything 
[Page 209, Line 63] you do.  

[Page 209, Line 65] 50. QAF  
[Page 209, Line 66] (Qaf) 
[Page 209, Line 67] In the name of  Allah,  
[Page 209, Line 68] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 209, Line 69] 1. Qaf. By the Glorious Quran.  
[Page 209, Line 70] 2. They marveled that a warner has come to 
[Page 209, Line 71] them from among them. The disbelievers say, 
[Page 209, Line 72] “This is something strange.  
[Page 209, Line 73] 3. When we have died and become dust? This 
[Page 209, Line 74] is a farfetched return.”  
[Page 209, Line 75] 4. We k now what the earth consumes of them, 
[Page 209, Line 76] and with Us is a comprehensive book.  
[Page 209, Line 77] 5. But they denied the truth when it has come 
[Page 209, Line 78] to them, so they are in a confused state.  
[Page 209, Line 79] 6. Have they not observed the sky above them, 
[Page 209, Line 80] how We constructed it, and decorated it, and 
[Page 209, Line 81] it has no cracks?  
[Page 209, Line 82] 7. And the earth, how We spread it out, and 
[Page 209, Line 83] set on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds 
[Page 209, Line 84] of delightful pairs?  
[Page 209, Line 85] 198 
[Page 210, Line 1] 50.  QAF   (Qaf)  
[Page 210, Line 2] 8. A lesson and a reminder for every penitent 
[Page 210, Line 3] worshiper.  
[Page 210, Line 4] 9. And We brought down from the sky blessed 
[Page 210, Line 5] water, and produced with it gardens and 
[Page 210, Line 6] grain to harvest.  
[Page 210, Line 7] 10. And the soaring palm trees, with clustered 
[Page 210, Line 8] dates.  
[Page 210, Line 9] 11. As sustenance for the servants. And We re-
[Page 210, Line 10] vive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the res-
[Page 210, Line 11] urrection.  
[Page 210, Line 12] 12. Before them the people of Noah denied the 
[Page 210, Line 13] truth, and so did the dwellers of Russ, and 
[Page 210, Line 14] Thamood.  
[Page 210, Line 15] 13. And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of 
[Page 210, Line 16] Lot. 
[Page 210, Line 17] 14. And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the 
[Page 210, Line 18] people of Tubba. They all rejected the mes-
[Page 210, Line 19] sengers, so My threat came true.  
[Page 210, Line 20] 15. Were We fatigued by the first creation? But 
[Page 210, Line 21] they are  in doubt of a new creation.  
[Page 210, Line 22] 16. We created the human being, and We 
[Page 210, Line 23] know what his soul whispers to him. We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.  
[Page 210, Line 24] 17. As the two receivers receive, seated to the 
[Page 210, Line 25] right and to the left.  
[Page 210, Line 26] 18. Not a word does he utter, but the re is a 
[Page 210, Line 27] watcher by him, ready.  
[Page 210, Line 28] 19. The daze of death has come in truth: “This 
[Page 210, Line 29] is what you tried to evade.”  
[Page 210, Line 30] 20. And the Trumpet is blown: “This is the 
[Page 210, Line 31] Promised Day.”  
[Page 210, Line 32] 21. And every soul will come forward, accom-
[Page 210, Line 33] panied by a driver and a witness.  
[Page 210, Line 34] 22. “You were in neglect of this, so We lifted 
[Page 210, Line 35] your screen from you, and your vision today 
[Page 210, Line 36] is keen.”  
[Page 210, Line 37] 23. And His escort will say, “This is what I have 
[Page 210, Line 38] ready with me.”  
[Page 210, Line 39] 24. “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbe-
[Page 210, Line 40] liever.  
[Page 210, Line 41] 25. Preventer of good, aggressor, doubter.  
[Page 210, Line 42] 26. Who fab ricated another god with Allah; 
[Page 210, Line 43] toss him into the intense agony.”  27. His escort will say, “Our Lord, I did not 
[Page 210, Line 44] make him rebel, but he was far astray.”  
[Page 210, Line 45] 28. He will say, “Do not feud in My presence —
[Page 210, Line 46] I had warned you in advance.  
[Page 210, Line 47] 29. The decree from Me will no t be changed, 
[Page 210, Line 48] and I am not unjust to the servants.”  
[Page 210, Line 49] 30. On the Day when We will say to Hell, “Are 
[Page 210, Line 50] you full?” And it will say, “Are there any 
[Page 210, Line 51] more?”  
[Page 210, Line 52] 31. And Paradise will be brought closer to the 
[Page 210, Line 53] pious, not far away.  
[Page 210, Line 54] 32. “This is what you were promised —for 
[Page 210, Line 55] every careful penitent.  
[Page 210, Line 56] 33. Who inwardly feared the Most Gracious, 
[Page 210, Line 57] and came with a repentant heart.  
[Page 210, Line 58] 34. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eter-
[Page 210, Line 59] nity.”  
[Page 210, Line 60] 35. Therein they will have whatever they de-
[Page 210, Line 61] sire—and We have even more.  
[Page 210, Line 62] 36. How many generations before them, who 
[Page 210, Line 63] were more powerful than they, did We de-
[Page 210, Line 64] stroy? They explored the lands —was there 
[Page 210, Line 65] any escape?  
[Page 210, Line 66] 37. In that is a reminder for whoever possesses 
[Page 210, Line 67] a heart, or cares to listen and witness.  
[Page 210, Line 68] 38. We created the heavens and the earth and 
[Page 210, Line 69] what is between them  in six days, and no fa-
[Page 210, Line 70] tigue touched Us.  
[Page 210, Line 71] 39. So endure what they say, and proclaim the 
[Page 210, Line 72] praises of your Lord before the rising of the 
[Page 210, Line 73] sun, and before sunset.  
[Page 210, Line 74] 40. And glorify Him during the night, and at 
[Page 210, Line 75] the end of devotions.  
[Page 210, Line 76] 41. And listen for the Day when the caller calls 
[Page 210, Line 77] from a nearby place.  
[Page 210, Line 78] 42. The Day when they will hear the Shout in 
[Page 210, Line 79] all truth. That is the Day of Emergence.  
[Page 210, Line 80] 43. It is We who control life and death, and to 
[Page 210, Line 81] Us is the destination.  
[Page 210, Line 82] 44. The Day when the earth will crack for them 
[Page 210, Line 83] at once. That is an easy gathering for Us.  
[Page 210, Line 84] 199 
[Page 211, Line 1] 51.  THE SPREADERS   (adh-Dhariyat)  
[Page 211, Line 2] 45. We are fully aware of what they say, and 
[Page 211, Line 3] you are not a dictator over them. So remind 
[Page 211, Line 4] by the Quran whoever fears My warning.  

[Page 211, Line 6] 51. THE SPREADERS  
[Page 211, Line 7] (adh-Dhariyat ) 
[Page 211, Line 8] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 211, Line 9] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 211, Line 10] 1. By the spreaders spreading.  
[Page 211, Line 11] 2. And those carrying loads.  
[Page 211, Line 12] 3. And those moving gently.  
[Page 211, Line 13] 4. And those distributing as commanded.  
[Page 211, Line 14] 5. What you are promised is true.  
[Page 211, Line 15] 6. Judgment will take place.  
[Page 211, Line 16] 7. By the sky that is woven.  
[Page 211, Line 17] 8. You differ in what you say.  
[Page 211, Line 18] 9. Averted from  it is he who is averted.  
[Page 211, Line 19] 10. Perish the imposters.  
[Page 211, Line 20] 11. Those who are dazed in ignorance.  
[Page 211, Line 21] 12. They ask, “When is the Day of Judgment?”  
[Page 211, Line 22] 13. The Day they are presented to the Fire.  
[Page 211, Line 23] 14. “Taste your ordeal. This is what you used 
[Page 211, Line 24] to challenge.”  
[Page 211, Line 25] 15. But the piou s are amidst gardens and 
[Page 211, Line 26] springs.  
[Page 211, Line 27] 16. Receiving what their Lord has given them. 
[Page 211, Line 28] They were virtuous before that.  
[Page 211, Line 29] 17. They used to sleep a little at night.  
[Page 211, Line 30] 18. And at dawn, they would pray for pardon.  
[Page 211, Line 31] 19. And in their wealth, there was a share for 
[Page 211, Line 32] the beggar  and the deprived.  
[Page 211, Line 33] 20. And on earth are signs for the convinced.  
[Page 211, Line 34] 21. And within yourselves. Do you not see?  
[Page 211, Line 35] 22. And in the heaven is your livelihood, and 
[Page 211, Line 36] what you are promised.  
[Page 211, Line 37] 23. By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it 
[Page 211, Line 38] is as true as the fact that you  speak.  24. Has the story of Abraham’s honorable 
[Page 211, Line 39] guests reached you?  
[Page 211, Line 40] 25. When they entered upon him, they said, 
[Page 211, Line 41] “Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”  
[Page 211, Line 42] 26. Then he slipped away to his family, and 
[Page 211, Line 43] brought a fatted calf.  
[Page 211, Line 44] 27. He set it before them. He said, “Will you 
[Page 211, Line 45] not eat?”  
[Page 211, Line 46] 28. And he harbored fear of them. They said, 
[Page 211, Line 47] “Do not fear,” and they announced to him the 
[Page 211, Line 48] good news of a knowledgeable boy.  
[Page 211, Line 49] 29. His wife came forward crying. She clasped 
[Page 211, Line 50] her face, and said, “A barren old woman?”  
[Page 211, Line 51] 30. They said, “Thus spoke your Lord. He is 
[Page 211, Line 52] the Wise, the Knowing.”  
[Page 211, Line 53] 31. He said, “What is your business, O en-
[Page 211, Line 54] voys?”  
[Page 211, Line 55] 32. They said, “We are sent to a people guilty 
[Page 211, Line 56] of sin.”  
[Page 211, Line 57] 33. “To unleash upon them rocks of clay.”  
[Page 211, Line 58] 34. “Marked by your Lord for the excessive.”  
[Page 211, Line 59] 35. We evacuated all the  believers who were in 
[Page 211, Line 60] it. 
[Page 211, Line 61] 36. But found in it only one household of Mus-
[Page 211, Line 62] lims.  
[Page 211, Line 63] 37. And We left in it a sign for those who fear 
[Page 211, Line 64] the painful punishment.  
[Page 211, Line 65] 38. And in Moses. We sent him to Pharaoh 
[Page 211, Line 66] with a clear authority.  
[Page 211, Line 67] 39. But he turned away with his warlords,  and 
[Page 211, Line 68] said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”  
[Page 211, Line 69] 40. So We seized him and his troops, and 
[Page 211, Line 70] threw them into the sea, and He was to 
[Page 211, Line 71] blame.  
[Page 211, Line 72] 41. And in Aad. We unleashed against them 
[Page 211, Line 73] the devastating wind.  
[Page 211, Line 74] 42. It spared nothing it came upon, but ren-
[Page 211, Line 75] dered it like decayed ruins.  
[Page 211, Line 76] 43. And in Thamood. They were told, “Enjoy 
[Page 211, Line 77] yourselves for a while.”  
[Page 211, Line 78] 200 
[Page 212, Line 1] 52.  THE MOUNT   (at-Tur) 
[Page 212, Line 2] 44. But they defied the command of their Lord, 
[Page 212, Line 3] so the lightning struck them as they looked 
[Page 212, Line 4] on. 
[Page 212, Line 5] 45. They could not rise up, nor could they find 
[Page 212, Line 6] help.  
[Page 212, Line 7] 46. And before that, the people of Noah. They 
[Page 212, Line 8] were immoral people.  
[Page 212, Line 9] 47. We constructed the universe with power, 
[Page 212, Line 10] and We are expanding it.  
[Page 212, Line 11] 48. And the earth— We spread it out —How 
[Page 212, Line 12] well We prepared it!  
[Page 212, Line 13] 49. We created all things in pairs, so that you 
[Page 212, Line 14] may reflect and ponder.  
[Page 212, Line 15] 50. “So flee towards Al lah. I am to you from 
[Page 212, Line 16] Him a clear warner.”  
[Page 212, Line 17] 51. “And do not set up any other god with Al-
[Page 212, Line 18] lah. I am to you from Him a clear warner.”  
[Page 212, Line 19] 52. Likewise, no messenger came to those be-
[Page 212, Line 20] fore them, but they said, “A sorcerer or a 
[Page 212, Line 21] madman.”  
[Page 212, Line 22] 53. Did they recommend it to on e another? In 
[Page 212, Line 23] fact, they are rebellious people.  
[Page 212, Line 24] 54. So turn away from them; you are not to 
[Page 212, Line 25] blame.  
[Page 212, Line 26] 55. And remind, for the reminder benefits the 
[Page 212, Line 27] believers.  
[Page 212, Line 28] 56. I did not create the jinn and the humans 
[Page 212, Line 29] except to worship Me.  
[Page 212, Line 30] 57. I need no livelihood from them , nor do I 
[Page 212, Line 31] need them to feed Me.  
[Page 212, Line 32] 58. Allah is the Provider, the One with Power, 
[Page 212, Line 33] the Strong.  
[Page 212, Line 34] 59. Those who do wrong will have their turn, 
[Page 212, Line 35] like the turn of their counterparts, so let them 
[Page 212, Line 36] not rush Me.  
[Page 212, Line 37] 60. So woe to those who disbelieve because of 
[Page 212, Line 38] that Day of  theirs which they are promised.  

[Page 212, Line 40] 52. THE MOUNT  
[Page 212, Line 41] (at-Tur) 
[Page 212, Line 42] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 212, Line 43] the Gracious, the Merciful  1. By the Mount.  
[Page 212, Line 44] 2. And a Book inscribed.  
[Page 212, Line 45] 3. In a published scroll.  
[Page 212, Line 46] 4. And the frequented House.  
[Page 212, Line 47] 5. And the elevated roof.  
[Page 212, Line 48] 6. And the seething sea.  
[Page 212, Line 49] 7. The punishment of your Lord is coming.  
[Page 212, Line 50] 8. There is nothing to avert it.  
[Page 212, Line 51] 9. On the Day when the heaven sways in agi-
[Page 212, Line 52] tation.  
[Page 212, Line 53] 10. And the mountains go into motion.  
[Page 212, Line 54] 11. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
[Page 212, Line 55] 12. Those who play with speculation.  
[Page 212, Line 56] 13. The Day when they are shoved into the Fire 
[Page 212, Line 57] of Hell forcefully.  
[Page 212, Line 58] 14. “This is the Fire which you used to deny.  
[Page 212, Line 59] 15. Is this magic, or do you not see?  
[Page 212, Line 60] 16. Burn in it. Whether you are patient, or im-
[Page 212, Line 61] patient, it is the same for you. You are only 
[Page 212, Line 62] being repaid for what you used  to do.”  
[Page 212, Line 63] 17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and 
[Page 212, Line 64] bliss.  
[Page 212, Line 65] 18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them, 
[Page 212, Line 66] and their Lord has spared them the suffering of Hell.  
[Page 212, Line 67] 19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to 
[Page 212, Line 68] do. 
[Page 212, Line 69] 20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and  We 
[Page 212, Line 70] will couple them with gorgeous spouses.  
[Page 212, Line 71] 21. Those who believed, and their offspring 
[Page 212, Line 72] followed them in faith— We will unite them 
[Page 212, Line 73] with their offspring, and We will not deprive 
[Page 212, Line 74] them of any of their works. Every person is 
[Page 212, Line 75] hostage to what he has earned.  
[Page 212, Line 76] 22. And We will supply them with fruit, and 
[Page 212, Line 77] meat; such as they desire.  
[Page 212, Line 78] 23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein 
[Page 212, Line 79] is neither harm, nor sin.  
[Page 212, Line 80] 24. Serving them will be youths like hidden 
[Page 212, Line 81] pearls.  
[Page 212, Line 82] 201 
[Page 213, Line 1] 53.  THE STAR   (an-Najm)  
[Page 213, Line 2] 25. And they will approach one another, in-
[Page 213, Line 3] quiring.  
[Page 213, Line 4] 26. They will s ay, “Before this, we were fearful 
[Page 213, Line 5] for our families.  
[Page 213, Line 6] 27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag-
[Page 213, Line 7] ony of the Fiery Winds.  
[Page 213, Line 8] 28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is 
[Page 213, Line 9] the Good, the Compassionate.”  
[Page 213, Line 10] 29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you 
[Page 213, Line 11] are neither  a soothsayer, nor a madman.  
[Page 213, Line 12] 30. Or do they say, “A poet— we await for him 
[Page 213, Line 13] a calamity of time”?  
[Page 213, Line 14] 31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with 
[Page 213, Line 15] you.”  
[Page 213, Line 16] 32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to 
[Page 213, Line 17] this? Or are they aggressive people?  
[Page 213, Line 18] 33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather, 
[Page 213, Line 19] they do not believe.  
[Page 213, Line 20] 34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if 
[Page 213, Line 21] they are truthful.  
[Page 213, Line 22] 35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or 
[Page 213, Line 23] are they the creators?  
[Page 213, Line 24] 36. Or did they create the heavens and the 
[Page 213, Line 25] earth? In fact, they are not certain.  
[Page 213, Line 26] 37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your 
[Page 213, Line 27] Lord? Or are they the controllers?  
[Page 213, Line 28] 38. Or do they have a stairway by means of 
[Page 213, Line 29] which they listen? Then let their listener pro-
[Page 213, Line 30] duce a clear proof.  
[Page 213, Line 31] 39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the 
[Page 213, Line 32] sons?  
[Page 213, Line 33] 40. Or do you  demand a payment from them, 
[Page 213, Line 34] and they are burdened by debt?  
[Page 213, Line 35] 41. Or do they know the future, and they are 
[Page 213, Line 36] writing it down?  
[Page 213, Line 37] 42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The 
[Page 213, Line 38] conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.  
[Page 213, Line 39] 43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah 
[Page 213, Line 40] transcends what they associate.  
[Page 213, Line 41] 44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky 
[Page 213, Line 42] falling down, they would say, “A mass of 
[Page 213, Line 43] clouds.”  45. So leave them until they meet their Day in 
[Page 213, Line 44] which they will be stunned.  
[Page 213, Line 45] 46. The Day when their ploys will avail them 
[Page 213, Line 46] nothing; and they will not be helped.  
[Page 213, Line 47] 47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish-
[Page 213, Line 48] ment besides that; but most of them do not 
[Page 213, Line 49] know.  
[Page 213, Line 50] 48. So patiently await the decision of your 
[Page 213, Line 51] Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro-
[Page 213, Line 52] claim the praises of your Lord when you 
[Page 213, Line 53] arise.  
[Page 213, Line 54] 49. And glorify Him during the night, and at 
[Page 213, Line 55] the receding of the stars.  

[Page 213, Line 57] 53. THE STAR  
[Page 213, Line 58] (an-Najm)  
[Page 213, Line 59] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 213, Line 60] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 213, Line 61] 1. By the star as it goes down.  
[Page 213, Line 62] 2. Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he 
[Page 213, Line 63] erred.  
[Page 213, Line 64] 3. Nor does he speak out of desire.  
[Page 213, Line 65] 4. It is but a revelation revealed.  
[Page 213, Line 66] 5. Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful.  
[Page 213, Line 67] 6. The one of vigor. He settled.  
[Page 213, Line 68] 7. While he was at the highest horizon.  
[Page 213, Line 69] 8. Then he came near, and hovered around.  
[Page 213, Line 70] 9. He was within two bows’ length, or closer.  
[Page 213, Line 71] 10. Then He revealed to His servant what He 
[Page 213, Line 72] revealed.  
[Page 213, Line 73] 11. The heart did not lie about what it saw.  
[Page 213, Line 74] 12. Will you dispute with him concerning 
[Page 213, Line 75] what he saw?  
[Page 213, Line 76] 13. He saw him on another descent.  
[Page 213, Line 77] 14. At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.  
[Page 213, Line 78] 15. Near which is the Garden of Repose.  
[Page 213, Line 79] 16. As there covered the Lotus Tree what cov-
[Page 213, Line 80] ered it.  
[Page 213, Line 81] 17. The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed.  
[Page 213, Line 82] 202 
[Page 214, Line 1] 53.  THE STAR   (an-Najm)  
[Page 214, Line 2] 18. He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.  
[Page 214, Line 3] 19. Have you considered al -Lat and al -Uzza?  
[Page 214, Line 4] 20. And Manat, the third one, the other?  
[Page 214, Line 5] 21. Are you to have the males, and He the fe-
[Page 214, Line 6] males?  
[Page 214, Line 7] 22. What a bizarre distribution.  
[Page 214, Line 8] 23. These are nothing but names, which you 
[Page 214, Line 9] have devised, you and your ancestors, for 
[Page 214, Line 10] which Allah sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and what 
[Page 214, Line 11] the ego desires, ev en though guidance has 
[Page 214, Line 12] come to them from their Lord.  
[Page 214, Line 13] 24. Or is the human being to have whatever he 
[Page 214, Line 14] desires?  
[Page 214, Line 15] 25. To Allah belong the Last and the First.  
[Page 214, Line 16] 26. How many an angel is there in the heavens 
[Page 214, Line 17] whose intercession avails nothing, except af-
[Page 214, Line 18] ter Allah give s permission to whomever He 
[Page 214, Line 19] wills, and approves?  
[Page 214, Line 20] 27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter 
[Page 214, Line 21] give the angels the names of females.  
[Page 214, Line 22] 28. They have no knowledge of that. They only 
[Page 214, Line 23] follow assumptions, and assumptions are no 
[Page 214, Line 24] substitute for the truth.  
[Page 214, Line 25] 29. So a void him who has turned away from 
[Page 214, Line 26] Our remembrance, and desires nothing but the present life.  
[Page 214, Line 27] 30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your 
[Page 214, Line 28] Lord knows best who has strayed from His 
[Page 214, Line 29] path, and He knows best who has accepted 
[Page 214, Line 30] guidance.  
[Page 214, Line 31] 31. To Allah belongs wh atever is in the heav-
[Page 214, Line 32] ens and whatever is on earth. He will repay 
[Page 214, Line 33] those who do evil according to their deeds, 
[Page 214, Line 34] and recompense those who do good with the 
[Page 214, Line 35] best.  
[Page 214, Line 36] 32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen-
[Page 214, Line 37] cies—except for minor lapses —your Lord is 
[Page 214, Line 38] of Vast Forgive ness. He knows you well, ever 
[Page 214, Line 39] since He created you from the earth, and ever 
[Page 214, Line 40] since you were embryos in your mothers’ 
[Page 214, Line 41] wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue; 
[Page 214, Line 42] He is fully aware of the righteous.  33. Have you considered him who turned 
[Page 214, Line 43] away?  
[Page 214, Line 44] 34. And gave a little, and held back?  
[Page 214, Line 45] 35. Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, 
[Page 214, Line 46] and can therefore foresee?  
[Page 214, Line 47] 36. Or was he not informed of what is in the 
[Page 214, Line 48] Scrolls of Moses?  
[Page 214, Line 49] 37. And of Abraham, who fulfilled?  
[Page 214, Line 50] 38. That no soul bears the burdens of another 
[Page 214, Line 51] soul.  
[Page 214, Line 52] 39. And that the human being attains only 
[Page 214, Line 53] what he strives for.  
[Page 214, Line 54] 40. And that his efforts will be witnessed.  
[Page 214, Line 55] 41. Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest 
[Page 214, Line 56] reward.  
[Page 214, Line 57] 42. And that to your Lord is the finality.  
[Page 214, Line 58] 43. And that it is He who causes laughter and 
[Page 214, Line 59] weeping.  
[Page 214, Line 60] 44. And that it is He who gives death and life.  
[Page 214, Line 61] 45. And that it is He who created the two 
[Page 214, Line 62] kinds —the male and the female.  
[Page 214, Line 63] 46. From a sperm drop, when emitted.  
[Page 214, Line 64] 47. And that upon Him is the next existence.  
[Page 214, Line 65] 48. And that it is He who enriches and impov-
[Page 214, Line 66] erishes.  
[Page 214, Line 67] 49. And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.  
[Page 214, Line 68] 50. And that it is He who destroyed the first 
[Page 214, Line 69] Aad.  
[Page 214, Line 70] 51. And Thamood, sparing no one.  
[Page 214, Line 71] 52. And the people of Noah before that; for 
[Page 214, Line 72] they were most unjust and most oppressive.  
[Page 214, Line 73] 53. And He toppled the ruined cities.  
[Page 214, Line 74] 54. And covered them with whatever covered 
[Page 214, Line 75] them.  
[Page 214, Line 76] 55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you 
[Page 214, Line 77] deny?  
[Page 214, Line 78] 56. This is a warning, just like the first warn-
[Page 214, Line 79] ings.  
[Page 214, Line 80] 57. The inevitable is imminent.  
[Page 214, Line 81] 58. None besides Allah can unveil it.  
[Page 214, Line 82] 203 
[Page 215, Line 1] 54.  THE MOON   (al-Qamar)  
[Page 215, Line 2] 59. Do you marvel at this discourse ? 
[Page 215, Line 3] 60. And laugh, and do not weep?  
[Page 215, Line 4] 61. Lost in your frivolity?  
[Page 215, Line 5] 62. So bow down to Allah, and worship!  

[Page 215, Line 7] 54. THE MOON  
[Page 215, Line 8] (al-Qamar ) 
[Page 215, Line 9] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 215, Line 10] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 215, Line 11] 1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon 
[Page 215, Line 12] has split.  
[Page 215, Line 13] 2. Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn 
[Page 215, Line 14] away, and say, “Continuous magic.”  
[Page 215, Line 15] 3. They lied, and followed their opinions, but 
[Page 215, Line 16] everything has its time.  
[Page 215, Line 17] 4. And there came to them news containing a 
[Page 215, Line 18] deterrent.  
[Page 215, Line 19] 5. Profound wisdom —but warnings are of no 
[Page 215, Line 20] avail.  
[Page 215, Line 21] 6. So turn away from them.  On the Day when 
[Page 215, Line 22] the Caller calls to something terrible.  
[Page 215, Line 23] 7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge 
[Page 215, Line 24] from the graves, as if they were swarming lo-
[Page 215, Line 25] custs.  
[Page 215, Line 26] 8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe-
[Page 215, Line 27] lievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”  
[Page 215, Line 28] 9. Before them the people of Noah disbelieved. 
[Page 215, Line 29] They rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,” and he was rebuked.  
[Page 215, Line 30] 10. So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over-
[Page 215, Line 31] whelmed, so help me.”  
[Page 215, Line 32] 11. So We opened the floodgates of heaven 
[Page 215, Line 33] with water pouring down.  
[Page 215, Line 34] 12. And We made the earth bur st with springs, 
[Page 215, Line 35] and the waters met for a purpose already des-
[Page 215, Line 36] tined.  
[Page 215, Line 37] 13. And We carried him on a craft of planks 
[Page 215, Line 38] and nails.  
[Page 215, Line 39] 14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him 
[Page 215, Line 40] who was rejected.  15. And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone 
[Page 215, Line 41] who would take heed?  
[Page 215, Line 42] 16. So how were My punishment and My 
[Page 215, Line 43] warnings?  
[Page 215, Line 44] 17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there 
[Page 215, Line 45] anyone who would learn?  
[Page 215, Line 46] 18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My 
[Page 215, Line 47] punishment and My warnings? 
[Page 215, Line 48] 19. We unleashed upon them a screaming 
[Page 215, Line 49] wind, on a day of unrelenting mis ery. 
[Page 215, Line 50] 20. Plucking the people away, as though they 
[Page 215, Line 51] were trunks of uprooted palm -trees.  
[Page 215, Line 52] 21. So how were My punishment and My 
[Page 215, Line 53] warnings?  
[Page 215, Line 54] 22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is 
[Page 215, Line 55] there anyone who would remember?  
[Page 215, Line 56] 23. Thamood rejected the warnings.  
[Page 215, Line 57] 24. They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a 
[Page 215, Line 58] human being? We would then go astray, and 
[Page 215, Line 59] end up in Hell.  
[Page 215, Line 60] 25. Was the message given to him, out of all of 
[Page 215, Line 61] us? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”  
[Page 215, Line 62] 26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked 
[Page 215, Line 63] liar is.  
[Page 215, Line 64] 27. We are sending the she -camel as a test for 
[Page 215, Line 65] them; so watch them and be patient.  
[Page 215, Line 66] 28. And inform them that the water is to be 
[Page 215, Line 67] shared between them; each share of drink 
[Page 215, Line 68] made available.  
[Page 215, Line 69] 29. But they called their friend, and he dared, 
[Page 215, Line 70] and he slaughtered.  
[Page 215, Line 71] 30. So how were My punishment and My 
[Page 215, Line 72] warnings?  
[Page 215, Line 73] 31. We sent against them a single Scream, and 
[Page 215, Line 74] they became like crushed hay.  
[Page 215, Line 75] 32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is 
[Page 215, Line 76] there anyone who would understand?  
[Page 215, Line 77] 33. The people of Lot rejected the warnings.  
[Page 215, Line 78] 34. We unleashed upon them a shower of  
[Page 215, Line 79] stones, except for the family of Lot; We res-cued them at dawn.  
[Page 215, Line 80] 204 
[Page 216, Line 1] 55.  THE COMPASSIONATE   (ar-Rahman)  
[Page 216, Line 2] 35. A blessing from Us. Thus We reward the 
[Page 216, Line 3] thankful.  
[Page 216, Line 4] 36. He had warned them of Our onslaught, but 
[Page 216, Line 5] they dismissed the warnings.  
[Page 216, Line 6] 37. They even lusted for his guest, so We oblit-
[Page 216, Line 7] erated their eyes.  “So taste My punishment 
[Page 216, Line 8] and My warnings.”  
[Page 216, Line 9] 38. Early morning brought upon them endur-
[Page 216, Line 10] ing punishment.  
[Page 216, Line 11] 39. So taste My punishment and My warnings.  
[Page 216, Line 12] 40. We made the Quran easy to memorize. Is 
[Page 216, Line 13] there anyone who would memorize?  
[Page 216, Line 14] 41. The warnings also came to the pe ople of 
[Page 216, Line 15] Pharaoh.  
[Page 216, Line 16] 42. They rejected Our signs, all of them, so We 
[Page 216, Line 17] seized them —the seizure of an Almighty 
[Page 216, Line 18] Omnipotent.  
[Page 216, Line 19] 43. Are your unbelievers better than all those? 
[Page 216, Line 20] Or do you have immunity in the scriptures?  
[Page 216, Line 21] 44. Or do they say, “We are united, and we will 
[Page 216, Line 22] be victorious”?  
[Page 216, Line 23] 45. The multitude will be defeated, and they 
[Page 216, Line 24] will turn their backs.  
[Page 216, Line 25] 46. The Hour is their appointed time— the 
[Page 216, Line 26] Hour is more disastrous, and most bitter.  
[Page 216, Line 27] 47. The wicked are in confusion and madness.  
[Page 216, Line 28] 48. The Day when they are dragged upon their 
[Page 216, Line 29] faces into the Fire: “Taste the touch of Saqar.”  
[Page 216, Line 30] 49. Everything We created is precisely meas-
[Page 216, Line 31] ured.  
[Page 216, Line 32] 50. And Our command is but once, like the 
[Page 216, Line 33] twinkling of an eye.  
[Page 216, Line 34] 51. We have destroyed your likes. Is there an-
[Page 216, Line 35] yone who would ponder?  
[Page 216, Line 36] 52. Everything they have done is in the Books.  
[Page 216, Line 37] 53. Everything, small or large, is written down.  
[Page 216, Line 38] 54. The righteous will be amidst gardens and 
[Page 216, Line 39] rivers.  
[Page 216, Line 40] 55. In an assembly of virtue, in the presence of 
[Page 216, Line 41] an Omnipotent King.  
[Page 216, Line 42]   55. THE COMPASSIONATE  
[Page 216, Line 43] (ar-Rahman ) 
[Page 216, Line 44] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 216, Line 45] the G racious, the Merciful  
[Page 216, Line 46] 1. The Compassionate.  
[Page 216, Line 47] 2. Has taught the Quran.  
[Page 216, Line 48] 3. He created man.  
[Page 216, Line 49] 4. And taught him clear expression.  
[Page 216, Line 50] 5. The sun and the moon move according to 
[Page 216, Line 51] plan.  
[Page 216, Line 52] 6. And the stars and the trees prostrate them-
[Page 216, Line 53] selves.  
[Page 216, Line 54] 7. And the sky, He raised; and He set up the 
[Page 216, Line 55] balance.  
[Page 216, Line 56] 8. So do not transgress in the balance.  
[Page 216, Line 57] 9. But maintain the weights with justice, and 
[Page 216, Line 58] do not violate the balance.  
[Page 216, Line 59] 10. And the earth; He set up for the creatures.  
[Page 216, Line 60] 11. In it are fruits, and palms in clusters.  
[Page 216, Line 61] 12. And grains in the blad es, and fragrant 
[Page 216, Line 62] plants.  
[Page 216, Line 63] 13. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 216, Line 64] deny?  
[Page 216, Line 65] 14. He created man from hard clay, like bricks.  
[Page 216, Line 66] 15. And created the jinn from a fusion of fire.  
[Page 216, Line 67] 16. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 216, Line 68] deny?  
[Page 216, Line 69] 17. Lord of the two Easts and Lor d of the two 
[Page 216, Line 70] Wests.  
[Page 216, Line 71] 18. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 216, Line 72] deny?  
[Page 216, Line 73] 19. He merged the two seas, converging to-
[Page 216, Line 74] gether.  
[Page 216, Line 75] 20. Between them is a barrier, which they do 
[Page 216, Line 76] not overrun.  
[Page 216, Line 77] 21. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 216, Line 78] deny?  
[Page 216, Line 79] 22. From them emerge pearls  and coral.  
[Page 216, Line 80] 205 
[Page 217, Line 1] 55.  THE COMPASS IONATE   (ar-Rahman)  
[Page 217, Line 2] 23. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 3] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 4] 24. His are the ships, raised above the sea like 
[Page 217, Line 5] landmarks.  
[Page 217, Line 6] 25. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 7] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 8] 26. Everyone upon it is perishing.  
[Page 217, Line 9] 27. But will remain the Presence of your Lord, 
[Page 217, Line 10] Full of Majesty and Splendor.  
[Page 217, Line 11] 28. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 12] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 13] 29. Everyone in the heavens and the earth asks 
[Page 217, Line 14] Him. Every day He is managing.  
[Page 217, Line 15] 30. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 16] deny?

[Page 217, Line 19] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 20] 33. O society of jinn and humans! If you can 
[Page 217, Line 21] pass through the bounds of the heavens and 
[Page 217, Line 22] the earth, go ahead and pass. But you will not 
[Page 217, Line 23] pass except with authorization.  
[Page 217, Line 24] 34. So which of your Lord’s marvels will  you 
[Page 217, Line 25] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 26] 35. You will be bombarded with flares of fire 
[Page 217, Line 27] and brass, and you will not succeed.

[Page 217, Line 31] rose, like paint.  
[Page 217, Line 32] 38. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 33] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 34] 39. On that Day, no human and no jinn will be 
[Page 217, Line 35] asked about his sins.  
[Page 217, Line 36] 40. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 37] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 38] 41. The guilty will be recognized by their 
[Page 217, Line 39] marks; they will be taken by the forelocks and 
[Page 217, Line 40] the feet.  
[Page 217, Line 41] 42. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 42] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 43] 43. This is Hell that the guilty denied.  44. They circulate between it and between a 
[Page 217, Line 44] seething bath.  
[Page 217, Line 45] 45. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 46] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 47] 46. But for him who feared the standing of his 
[Page 217, Line 48] Lord are two gardens.  
[Page 217, Line 49] 47. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 50] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 51] 48. Full of varieties.  
[Page 217, Line 52] 49. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you

[Page 217, Line 55] 51. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 56] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 57] 52. In them are fruits of every kind, in pairs.  
[Page 217, Line 58] 53. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 59] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 60] 54. Reclining on furnishings lined with bro-

[Page 217, Line 62] near at hand.  
[Page 217, Line 63] 55. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 64] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 65] 56. In them are maidens restraining their

[Page 217, Line 67] jinn.  
[Page 217, Line 68] 57. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 69] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 70] 58. As though they were rubies and corals.  
[Page 217, Line 71] 59. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 217, Line 72] deny?  
[Page 217, Line 73] 60. Is the reward of goodness anything but 
[Page 217, Line 74] goodness?  
[Page 217, Line 75] 61. So which of your Lord’s marvels wil l you 
[Page 217, Line 76] deny?

[Page 218, Line 1] 56.  THE INEVITABLE   (al-Waqi’ah)  
[Page 218, Line 2] 67. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 218, Line 3] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 4] 68. In them are fruits, and date -palms, and 
[Page 218, Line 5] pomegranates.  
[Page 218, Line 6] 69. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 218, Line 7] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 8] 70. In them are good and beautiful ones.  
[Page 218, Line 9] 71. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 218, Line 10] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 11] 72. Companions, secluded in the tents.  
[Page 218, Line 12] 73. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 218, Line 13] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 14] 74. Whom no human has touched before, nor 
[Page 218, Line 15] jinn.  
[Page 218, Line 16] 75. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you 
[Page 218, Line 17] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 18] 76. Reclining on green cushions, and exquisite 
[Page 218, Line 19] carpets.

[Page 218, Line 21] deny?  
[Page 218, Line 22] 78. Blessed be the name of your Lord, Full of 
[Page 218, Line 23] Majesty and Splendor.  

[Page 218, Line 25] 56. THE INEVITABLE 
[Page 218, Line 26] (al-Waqi’ah ) 
[Page 218, Line 27] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 218, Line 28] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 218, Line 29] 1. When the inevitable occurs.  
[Page 218, Line 30] 2. Of its occurrence, there is no denial.  
[Page 218, Line 31] 3. Bringing low, raising high.  
[Page 218, Line 32] 4. When the eart h is shaken with a shock.  
[Page 218, Line 33] 5. And the mountains are crushed and crum-
[Page 218, Line 34] bled.  
[Page 218, Line 35] 6. And they become scattered dust.  
[Page 218, Line 36] 7. And you become three classes.  
[Page 218, Line 37] 8. Those on the Right— what of those on the 
[Page 218, Line 38] Right?  
[Page 218, Line 39] 9. And those on the Left— what of those on the 
[Page 218, Line 40] Left?  
[Page 218, Line 41] 10. And the f orerunners, the forerunners.  11. Those are the nearest.  
[Page 218, Line 42] 12. In the Gardens of Bliss.  
[Page 218, Line 43] 13. A throng from the ancients.  
[Page 218, Line 44] 14. And a small band from the latecomers.  
[Page 218, Line 45] 15. On luxurious furnishings.  
[Page 218, Line 46] 16. Reclining on them, facing one another.  
[Page 218, Line 47] 17. Serving them will be immortalized youth.  
[Page 218, Line 48] 18. With cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks.  
[Page 218, Line 49] 19. Causing them neither headache, nor intox-
[Page 218, Line 50] ication.  
[Page 218, Line 51] 20. And fruits of their choice.  
[Page 218, Line 52] 21. And meat of birds that they may desire.  
[Page 218, Line 53] 22. And lovely companions.  
[Page 218, Line 54] 23. The likenesses of treasured pearls.  
[Page 218, Line 55] 24. As a reward for what they used to do.  
[Page 218, Line 56] 25. Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no 
[Page 218, Line 57] accusations.  
[Page 218, Line 58] 26. But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”  
[Page 218, Line 59] 27. And those on the Right —what of those on 
[Page 218, Line 60] the Right?  
[Page 218, Line 61] 28. In lush orchards.  
[Page 218, Line 62] 29. And sweet -smelling plants.  
[Page 218, Line 63] 30. And extended shade.  
[Page 218, Line 64] 31. And outpouring water.  
[Page 218, Line 65] 32. And abundant fruit.  
[Page 218, Line 66] 33. Neither withheld, nor forbidden.  
[Page 218, Line 67] 34. And uplifted mattresses.  
[Page 218, Line 68] 35. We have created them of special creation.  
[Page 218, Line 69] 36. And made them virgins.  
[Page 218, Line 70] 37. Tender and un- aging.  
[Page 218, Line 71] 38. For those on the Right.  
[Page 218, Line 72] 39. A throng from the ancients.  
[Page 218, Line 73] 40. And a throng from the latecomers.  
[Page 218, Line 74] 41. And those on the Left— what of those on 
[Page 218, Line 75] the Left?  
[Page 218, Line 76] 42. Amid searing wind and boiling water.  
[Page 218, Line 77] 43. And a shadow of thick smoke.  
[Page 218, Line 78] 207 
[Page 219, Line 1] 56.  THE INEVITABLE   (al-Waqi’ah)  
[Page 219, Line 2] 44. Neither cool, nor refreshing.  
[Page 219, Line 3] 45. They had lived before that in luxury.  
[Page 219, Line 4] 46. And they used to persist in immense 
[Page 219, Line 5] wrongdoing.  
[Page 219, Line 6] 47. And they used to say, “When we are dead 
[Page 219, Line 7] and turned into dust and bones, are we to be 
[Page 219, Line 8] resurrected?  
[Page 219, Line 9] 48. And our ancient ancestors too?”  
[Page 219, Line 10] 49. Say, “The first and the last.  
[Page 219, Line 11] 50. Will be gathered for the appointment of a 
[Page 219, Line 12] familiar Day.”  
[Page 219, Line 13] 51. Then you, you misguided, who deny the 
[Page 219, Line 14] truth.  
[Page 219, Line 15] 52. Will be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.  
[Page 219, Line 16] 53. Will be filling your bellies with it.  
[Page 219, Line 17] 54. Will be drinking on top of it boiling water.  
[Page 219, Line 18] 55. Drinking like thirsty camels drink.  
[Page 219, Line 19] 56. That is their hospitality on the Day of Ret-
[Page 219, Line 20] ribution.  
[Page 219, Line 21] 57. We created you —if only you would be-
[Page 219, Line 22] lieve!  
[Page 219, Line 23] 58. Have you seen what you ejaculate?  
[Page 219, Line 24] 59. Is it you who create it, or are We the Crea-
[Page 219, Line 25] tor? 
[Page 219, Line 26] 60. We have decreed dea th among you, and 
[Page 219, Line 27] We will not be outstripped.  
[Page 219, Line 28] 61. In replacing you with your likes, and trans-
[Page 219, Line 29] forming you into what you do not know.  
[Page 219, Line 30] 62. You have known the first formation; if only 
[Page 219, Line 31] you would remember.  
[Page 219, Line 32] 63. Have you seen what you cultivate?  
[Page 219, Line 33] 64. Is it you who make it grow, or are We the 
[Page 219, Line 34] Grower?  
[Page 219, Line 35] 65. If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then 
[Page 219, Line 36] you will lament.  
[Page 219, Line 37] 66. “We are penalized.  
[Page 219, Line 38] 67. No, we are being deprived.”  
[Page 219, Line 39] 68. Have you seen the water you drink?  
[Page 219, Line 40] 69. Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, 
[Page 219, Line 41] or are We th e Sender?  70. If We will, We can make it salty. Will you 
[Page 219, Line 42] not be thankful?  
[Page 219, Line 43] 71. Have you seen the fire you kindle?  
[Page 219, Line 44] 72. Is it you who produce its tree, or are We 
[Page 219, Line 45] the Producer?  
[Page 219, Line 46] 73. We have made it a reminder, and a comfort 
[Page 219, Line 47] for the users.  
[Page 219, Line 48] 74. So glorify the Name of your Great Lord.  
[Page 219, Line 49] 75. I swear by the locations of the stars.  
[Page 219, Line 50] 76. It is an oath, if you only knew, that is tre-
[Page 219, Line 51] mendous.  
[Page 219, Line 52] 77. It is a noble Quran.  
[Page 219, Line 53] 78. In a well -protected Book.  
[Page 219, Line 54] 79. None can grasp it except the purified.  
[Page 219, Line 55] 80. A revelation from the Lord of  the Worlds.  
[Page 219, Line 56] 81. Is it this discourse that you take so lightly?  
[Page 219, Line 57] 82. And you make it your livelihood to deny it?  
[Page 219, Line 58] 83. So when it has reached the throat.  
[Page 219, Line 59] 84. As you are looking on.  
[Page 219, Line 60] 85. We are nearer to it than you are, but you 
[Page 219, Line 61] do not see.  
[Page 219, Line 62] 86. If you are not h eld to account.  
[Page 219, Line 63] 87. Then bring it back, if you are truthful.  
[Page 219, Line 64] 88. But if he is one of those brought near.  
[Page 219, Line 65] 89. Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden 
[Page 219, Line 66] of Delights.  
[Page 219, Line 67] 90. And if he is one of those on the Right.  
[Page 219, Line 68] 91. Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the 
[Page 219, Line 69] Righ t. 
[Page 219, Line 70] 92. But if he is one of the deniers, the mistaken.  
[Page 219, Line 71] 93. Then a welcome of Inferno.  
[Page 219, Line 72] 94. And burning in Hell.  
[Page 219, Line 73] 95. This is the certain truth.  
[Page 219, Line 74] 96. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Mag-
[Page 219, Line 75] nificent  

[Page 219, Line 77] 208 
[Page 220, Line 1] 57.  IRON   (al-Hadid`)  
[Page 220, Line 2] 57. IRON  
[Page 220, Line 3] (al-Hadid` ) 
[Page 220, Line 4] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 220, Line 5] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 220, Line 6] 1. Glorifying Allah is everything in the heav-
[Page 220, Line 7] ens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the 
[Page 220, Line 8] Wise.  
[Page 220, Line 9] 2. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heav-
[Page 220, Line 10] ens and the earth. He gives life and causes 
[Page 220, Line 11] death, and He has power over all things.  
[Page 220, Line 12] 3. He is the First and the Last, and the Outer 
[Page 220, Line 13] and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all things.  
[Page 220, Line 14] 4. It is He who created the heavens and the 
[Page 220, Line 15] earth in six days, then settled over the 
[Page 220, Line 16] Throne. He knows what penetrates into the 
[Page 220, Line 17] earth, and what comes out of it, and what de-
[Page 220, Line 18] scends fro m the sky, and what ascends to it. 
[Page 220, Line 19] And He is with you wherever you may be. Al-
[Page 220, Line 20] lah is Seeing of everything you do.  
[Page 220, Line 21] 5. To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens 
[Page 220, Line 22] and the earth, and to Allah all matters are re-
[Page 220, Line 23] ferred.  
[Page 220, Line 24] 6. He merges the night into the day, and He 
[Page 220, Line 25] merges the day into the night; and He knows 
[Page 220, Line 26] what the hearts contains.  
[Page 220, Line 27] 7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and 
[Page 220, Line 28] spend from what He made you inherit. Those 
[Page 220, Line 29] among you who believe and give will have a 
[Page 220, Line 30] great reward.  
[Page 220, Line 31] 8. What is the matter with you that you do not 
[Page 220, Line 32] believe in Allah, when the Messenger calls 
[Page 220, Line 33] you to believe in your Lord, and He has re-
[Page 220, Line 34] ceived a pledge from you, if you are believers?  
[Page 220, Line 35] 9. It is He who sends down upon His servant 
[Page 220, Line 36] clear revelations, to bring you out of darkness 
[Page 220, Line 37] into the light. Allah is G entle towards you, 
[Page 220, Line 38] Most Compassionate.  
[Page 220, Line 39] 10. And why is it that you do not spend in the 
[Page 220, Line 40] cause of Allah, when to Allah belongs the in-heritance of the heavens and the earth? Not equal among you are those who contributed 
[Page 220, Line 41] before the conquest, and fought. Those a re 
[Page 220, Line 42] higher in rank than those who contributed afterwards, and fought. But Allah promises 
[Page 220, Line 43] both a good reward. Allah is Well Experi-
[Page 220, Line 44] enced in what you do.  
[Page 220, Line 45] 11. Who is he who will lend Allah a loan of 
[Page 220, Line 46] goodness, that He may double it for him, and 
[Page 220, Line 47] will have a gener ous reward?  
[Page 220, Line 48] 12. On the Day when you see the believing 
[Page 220, Line 49] men and believing women —their light radi-
[Page 220, Line 50] ating ahead of them, and to their right: “Good 
[Page 220, Line 51] news for you today: gardens beneath which 
[Page 220, Line 52] rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is 
[Page 220, Line 53] the great triumph.”  
[Page 220, Line 54] 13. On the Day when the hypocritical men and 
[Page 220, Line 55] hypocritical women will say to those who be-
[Page 220, Line 56] lieved, “Wait for us; let us absorb some of 
[Page 220, Line 57] your light.” It will be said, “Go back behind 
[Page 220, Line 58] you, and seek light.” A wall will be raised be-
[Page 220, Line 59] tween them, in which is a door; within  it is 
[Page 220, Line 60] mercy, and outside it is agony.  
[Page 220, Line 61] 14. They will call to them, “Were we not with 
[Page 220, Line 62] you?” They will say, “Yes, but you cheated 
[Page 220, Line 63] your souls, and waited, and doubted, and be-
[Page 220, Line 64] came deluded by wishful thinking, until the 
[Page 220, Line 65] command of Allah arrived; and arrogance 
[Page 220, Line 66] deceived you regarding Allah.” 
[Page 220, Line 67] 15. “Therefore, today no ransom will be ac-
[Page 220, Line 68] cepted from you, nor from those who disbe-
[Page 220, Line 69] lieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your com-
[Page 220, Line 70] panion —what an evil fate!”  
[Page 220, Line 71] 16. Is it not time for those who believe to sur-
[Page 220, Line 72] render their hearts to  the remembrance of Al-
[Page 220, Line 73] lah, and to the truth that has come down, and 
[Page 220, Line 74] not be like those who were given the Book 
[Page 220, Line 75] previously, but time became prolonged for 
[Page 220, Line 76] them, so their hearts hardened, and many of them are sinners?  
[Page 220, Line 77] 17. Know that Allah revives the earth afte r its 
[Page 220, Line 78] death. We thus explain the revelations for 
[Page 220, Line 79] you, so that you may understand.  
[Page 220, Line 80] 18. The charitable men and charitable women, 
[Page 220, Line 81] who have loaned Allah a loan of righteous-
[Page 220, Line 82] ness—it will be multiplied for them, and for 
[Page 220, Line 83] them is a generous reward.  
[Page 220, Line 84] 19. Those who be lieve in Allah and His mes-
[Page 220, Line 85] sengers —these are the sincere and the wit-
[Page 220, Line 86] 209 
[Page 221, Line 1] 58.  THE ARGUMENT   (al-Mujadilah)  
[Page 221, Line 2] nesses with their Lord; they will have their re-
[Page 221, Line 3] ward and their light. But as for those who dis-
[Page 221, Line 4] believe and deny Our revelations —these are 
[Page 221, Line 5] the inmates of the Blaze.  
[Page 221, Line 6] 20. Know that the worldly l ife is only play, and 
[Page 221, Line 7] distraction, and glitter, and boasting among you, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is 
[Page 221, Line 8] like a rainfall that produces plants, and de-
[Page 221, Line 9] lights the disbelievers. But then it withers, 
[Page 221, Line 10] and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes 
[Page 221, Line 11] debris . While in the Hereafter there is severe 
[Page 221, Line 12] agony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac-
[Page 221, Line 13] ceptance. The life of this world is nothing but 
[Page 221, Line 14] enjoyment of vanity.  
[Page 221, Line 15] 21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; 
[Page 221, Line 16] and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the 
[Page 221, Line 17] earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah 
[Page 221, Line 18] and His messengers. That is the grace of Al-
[Page 221, Line 19] lah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al-
[Page 221, Line 20] lah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.  
[Page 221, Line 21] 22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your 
[Page 221, Line 22] souls, but it is in a Book, even before We 
[Page 221, Line 23] make it happe n. That is easy for Allah.  
[Page 221, Line 24] 23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes 
[Page 221, Line 25] you, nor exult over what He has given you. Allah does not love the proud snob.  
[Page 221, Line 26] 24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to 
[Page 221, Line 27] be stingy. Whoever turns away —Allah is the 
[Page 221, Line 28] Independent, th e Praiseworthy.  
[Page 221, Line 29] 25. We sent Our messengers with the clear 
[Page 221, Line 30] proofs, and We sent down with them the 
[Page 221, Line 31] Book and the Balance, that humanity may 
[Page 221, Line 32] uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in 
[Page 221, Line 33] which is violent force, and benefits for hu-
[Page 221, Line 34] manity. That Allah may know who su pports 
[Page 221, Line 35] Him and His messengers invisibly. Allah is 
[Page 221, Line 36] Strong and Powerful.  
[Page 221, Line 37] 26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab-
[Page 221, Line 38] lished in their line Prophethood and the 
[Page 221, Line 39] Scripture. Some of them are guided, but 
[Page 221, Line 40] many of them are sinners.  
[Page 221, Line 41] 27. Then We sent in their wake Our mess en-
[Page 221, Line 42] gers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary, 
[Page 221, Line 43] and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in 
[Page 221, Line 44] the hearts of those who followed him com-passion and mercy. But as for the monasti-
[Page 221, Line 45] cism which they invented —We did not or-
[Page 221, Line 46] dain it for them —only to seek Allah’s ap-
[Page 221, Line 47] prov al. But they did not observe it with its 
[Page 221, Line 48] due observance. So We gave those of them 
[Page 221, Line 49] who believed their reward, but many of them 
[Page 221, Line 50] are sinful.  
[Page 221, Line 51] 28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe 
[Page 221, Line 52] in His Messenger: He will give you a double 
[Page 221, Line 53] portion of His mercy, and will give you a light 
[Page 221, Line 54] by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-
[Page 221, Line 55] lah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 221, Line 56] 29. That the People of the Book may know that 
[Page 221, Line 57] they have no power whatsoever over Allah’s 
[Page 221, Line 58] grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He gives it to whomever H e wills. Allah is Pos-
[Page 221, Line 59] sessor of Great Grace.  

[Page 221, Line 61] 58. THE ARGUMENT  
[Page 221, Line 62] (al-Mujadilah ) 
[Page 221, Line 63] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 221, Line 64] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 221, Line 65] 1. Allah has heard the statement of she who 
[Page 221, Line 66] argued with you concerning her husband, as 
[Page 221, Line 67] she complained to Allah. Allah heard your 
[Page 221, Line 68] conversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.  
[Page 221, Line 69] 2. Those of you who estrange their wives by 
[Page 221, Line 70] equating them with their mothers —they are 
[Page 221, Line 71] not their mothers. Their mothers are none 
[Page 221, Line 72] else but those who gave birth to them. What 
[Page 221, Line 73] they say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is 
[Page 221, Line 74] Pardoning and Forgiving.  
[Page 221, Line 75] 3. Those who estrange their wives by equating 
[Page 221, Line 76] them with their mothers, then go back on what they said, must set free a slave before 
[Page 221, Line 77] they may touch one another. To this you are 
[Page 221, Line 78] exhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you 
[Page 221, Line 79] do. 
[Page 221, Line 80] 4. But whoever cannot find the means must 
[Page 221, Line 81] fast for two consecutive months before they 
[Page 221, Line 82] may touch one another. And if he is unable, 
[Page 221, Line 83] then the feeding of sixty needy people. This, 
[Page 221, Line 84] in order that you affirm your faith in Allah 
[Page 221, Line 85] and His Messenger. These are th e ordinances 
[Page 221, Line 86] 210 
[Page 222, Line 1] 58.  THE ARGUMENT   (al-Mujadilah)  
[Page 222, Line 2] of Allah. The unbelievers will have a painful 
[Page 222, Line 3] punishment.  
[Page 222, Line 4] 5. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen-
[Page 222, Line 5] ger will be subdued, as those before them 
[Page 222, Line 6] were subdued. We have revealed clear mes-
[Page 222, Line 7] sages. The unbelievers will have a demeaning punishment.  
[Page 222, Line 8] 6. On the Day when Allah resurrects them all, 
[Page 222, Line 9] and informs them of what they did. Allah has 
[Page 222, Line 10] kept count of it, but they have forgotten it. 
[Page 222, Line 11] Allah is Witness over everything.  
[Page 222, Line 12] 7. Do you not realize that Allah knows every-
[Page 222, Line 13] thing in the heavens and everything on earth? 
[Page 222, Line 14] There is no secret counsel between three, but 
[Page 222, Line 15] He is their fourth; nor between five, but He is 
[Page 222, Line 16] their sixth; nor less than that, nor more, but 
[Page 222, Line 17] He is with them wherever they may be. Then, 
[Page 222, Line 18] on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform 
[Page 222, Line 19] them of what they did. Allah has knowledge 
[Page 222, Line 20] of everything.  
[Page 222, Line 21] 8. Have you noted those who were prohibited 
[Page 222, Line 22] from conspiring secretly, but then reverted to 
[Page 222, Line 23] what they were prohibited from? They con-spire to commit sin, and aggression, and de-
[Page 222, Line 24] fiance of the Messenger. And when they 
[Page 222, Line 25] come to you, they greet you with a greeting 
[Page 222, Line 26] that Allah never greeted you with. And they 
[Page 222, Line 27] say within themselves, “Why does Allah not 
[Page 222, Line 28] punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough 
[Page 222, Line 29] for them. They will roast in it. What a miser-
[Page 222, Line 30] able destiny!  
[Page 222, Line 31] 9. O you who believe! When you conve rse se-
[Page 222, Line 32] cretly, do not converse in sin, and aggression, 
[Page 222, Line 33] and disobedience of the Messenger; but con-
[Page 222, Line 34] verse in virtue and piety; And fear Allah, to 
[Page 222, Line 35] Whom you will be gathered.  
[Page 222, Line 36] 10. Conspiracies are from Satan, that he may 
[Page 222, Line 37] dishearten those who believe; but he will not 
[Page 222, Line 38] harm them in the least, except by leave of Al-
[Page 222, Line 39] lah. So let the believers put their trust in Al-
[Page 222, Line 40] lah. 
[Page 222, Line 41] 11. O you who believe! When you are told to 
[Page 222, Line 42] make room in your gatherings, make room; 
[Page 222, Line 43] Allah will make room for you. And when you are told to disperse, disperse. Allah elevates 
[Page 222, Line 44] those among you who believe, and those given knowledge, many steps. Allah is Aware 
[Page 222, Line 45] of what you do.  
[Page 222, Line 46] 12. O you who believe! When you converse 
[Page 222, Line 47] privately with the Messenger, offer some-
[Page 222, Line 48] thing in charity before your conversation. 
[Page 222, Line 49] That is bette r for you, and purer. But if you 
[Page 222, Line 50] do not find the means —Allah is Forgiving 
[Page 222, Line 51] and Merciful.  
[Page 222, Line 52] 13. Are you reluctant to offer charity before 
[Page 222, Line 53] your conversation? If you do not do so, and 
[Page 222, Line 54] Allah pardons you, then perform the prayer, 
[Page 222, Line 55] and give alms, and obey Allah and His Mes-
[Page 222, Line 56] senger. Allah is Aware of what you do.  
[Page 222, Line 57] 14. Have you considered those who befriended 
[Page 222, Line 58] a people with whom Allah has become angry? 
[Page 222, Line 59] They are not of you, nor of them. And they 
[Page 222, Line 60] swear to a lie while they know.  
[Page 222, Line 61] 15. Allah has prepared for them a terrible pun-
[Page 222, Line 62] ishment. Evil is what they used to do.  
[Page 222, Line 63] 16. They took their oaths as a screen, and pre-
[Page 222, Line 64] vented others from Allah’s path. They will have a shameful punishment.  
[Page 222, Line 65] 17. Neither their possessions nor their chil-
[Page 222, Line 66] dren will avail them anything against Allah. 
[Page 222, Line 67] These are th e inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling 
[Page 222, Line 68] therein forever.  
[Page 222, Line 69] 18. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them 
[Page 222, Line 70] altogether —they will swear to Him, as they 
[Page 222, Line 71] swear to you, thinking that they are upon something. Indeed, they themselves are the liars.  
[Page 222, Line 72] 19. Satan has taken ho ld of them, and so has 
[Page 222, Line 73] caused them to forget the remembrance of 
[Page 222, Line 74] Allah. These are the partisans of Satan. In-
[Page 222, Line 75] deed, it is Satan’s partisans who are the losers.  
[Page 222, Line 76] 20. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen-
[Page 222, Line 77] ger are among the lowliest.  
[Page 222, Line 78] 21. Allah has written: “I will  certainly prevail, I 
[Page 222, Line 79] and My messengers.” Allah is Strong and 
[Page 222, Line 80] Mighty.  
[Page 222, Line 81] 22. You will not find a people who believe in 
[Page 222, Line 82] Allah and the Last Day, loving those who op-pose Allah and His Messenger, even if they 
[Page 222, Line 83] were their parents, or their children, or their 
[Page 222, Line 84] siblin gs, or their close relatives. These —He 
[Page 222, Line 85] 211 
[Page 223, Line 1] 59.  THE MOBILIZATION   (al-Hashr)  
[Page 223, Line 2] has inscribed faith in their hearts, and has 
[Page 223, Line 3] supported them with a spirit from Him. And 
[Page 223, Line 4] He will admit them into Gardens beneath 
[Page 223, Line 5] which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell 
[Page 223, Line 6] forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they 
[Page 223, Line 7] are pleased with Him. These are the partisans 
[Page 223, Line 8] of Allah. Indeed, it is Allah’s partisans who 
[Page 223, Line 9] are the successful.  

[Page 223, Line 11] 59. THE MOBILIZATION  
[Page 223, Line 12] (al-Hashr ) 
[Page 223, Line 13] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 223, Line 14] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 223, Line 15] 1. Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heav-
[Page 223, Line 16] ens and the  earth. He is the Almighty, the 
[Page 223, Line 17] Most Wise.  
[Page 223, Line 18] 2. It is He who evicted those who disbelieved 
[Page 223, Line 19] among the People of the Book from their 
[Page 223, Line 20] homes at the first mobilization. You did not 
[Page 223, Line 21] think they would leave, and they thought 
[Page 223, Line 22] their fortresses would protect them from Al-
[Page 223, Line 23] lah. But Allah came at them from where they 
[Page 223, Line 24] never expected, and threw terror into their 
[Page 223, Line 25] hearts. They wrecked their homes with their 
[Page 223, Line 26] own hands, and by the hands of the believers. 
[Page 223, Line 27] Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have in-
[Page 223, Line 28] sight.  
[Page 223, Line 29] 3. Had Allah not decreed e xile for them, He 
[Page 223, Line 30] would have punished them in this life. But in 
[Page 223, Line 31] the Hereafter they will have the punishment 
[Page 223, Line 32] of the Fire.  
[Page 223, Line 33] 4. That is because they opposed Allah and His 
[Page 223, Line 34] Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah —Allah 
[Page 223, Line 35] is stern in retribution.  
[Page 223, Line 36] 5. Whether you cut down a  tree, or leave it 
[Page 223, Line 37] standing on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He 
[Page 223, Line 38] will surely disgrace the sinners.  
[Page 223, Line 39] 6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His 
[Page 223, Line 40] Messenger from them; you spurred neither 
[Page 223, Line 41] horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au-
[Page 223, Line 42] thority to His messengers ove r whomever He 
[Page 223, Line 43] will. Allah is Able to do all things.  
[Page 223, Line 44] 7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger 
[Page 223, Line 45] from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela-
[Page 223, Line 46] tives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and 
[Page 223, Line 47] to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate 
[Page 223, Line 48] solely between the wealthy among you. 
[Page 223, Line 49] Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; 
[Page 223, Line 50] and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. 
[Page 223, Line 51] And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
[Page 223, Line 52] ment.  
[Page 223, Line 53] 8. To the poor refugees who were driven out 
[Page 223, Line 54] of their h omes and their possessions, as they 
[Page 223, Line 55] sought the favor of Allah and His approval, 
[Page 223, Line 56] and came to the aid of Allah and His Messen-
[Page 223, Line 57] ger. These are the sincere.  
[Page 223, Line 58] 9. And those who, before them, had settled in 
[Page 223, Line 59] the homeland, and had accepted faith. They love those who e migrated to them, and find 
[Page 223, Line 60] no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. 
[Page 223, Line 61] They give them priority over themselves, 
[Page 223, Line 62] even if they themselves are needy. Whoever 
[Page 223, Line 63] is protected from his natural greed —it is they 
[Page 223, Line 64] who are the successful.  
[Page 223, Line 65] 10. And those who came afte r them, saying, 
[Page 223, Line 66] “Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in 
[Page 223, Line 67] our hearts towards those who believe. Our 
[Page 223, Line 68] Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”  
[Page 223, Line 69] 11. Have you not considered those who act 
[Page 223, Line 70] hypocritically? They say to their brethren 
[Page 223, Line 71] who disbelieved among the People of the Book, “If you are evicted, we will leave with 
[Page 223, Line 72] you, and will not obey anyone against you; 
[Page 223, Line 73] and should anyone fight you, we will cer-tainly support you.” But Allah bears witness 
[Page 223, Line 74] that they are liars.  
[Page 223, Line 75] 12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with 
[Page 223, Line 76] them; and if anyone fights them, they will not support them; and if they go to their aid, they 
[Page 223, Line 77] will turn their backs and flee; then they will 
[Page 223, Line 78] receive no support.  
[Page 223, Line 79] 13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts 
[Page 223, Line 80] than fear of Allah. That is because they are a 
[Page 223, Line 81] people who do not understand.  
[Page 223, Line 82] 14. They will not fight you all together except 
[Page 223, Line 83] from fortified strongholds, or from behind 
[Page 223, Line 84] walls. Their hostility towards each other is se-
[Page 223, Line 85] vere. You would think they are united, but 
[Page 223, Line 86] 212 
[Page 224, Line 1] 60.  THE WOMAN TESTED   (al-Mumtahina)  
[Page 224, Line 2] their hearts are diverse. That is because they 
[Page 224, Line 3] are a people who do not understand.  
[Page 224, Line 4] 15. Like those shortly before them. They expe-
[Page 224, Line 5] rienced the consequences of their decisions. 
[Page 224, Line 6] For them is a painful punishment.  
[Page 224, Line 7] 16. Like the devil, when he says to the human 
[Page 224, Line 8] being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe-
[Page 224, Line 9] lieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear 
[Page 224, Line 10] Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.”  
[Page 224, Line 11] 17. The ultimate end for both of them is the 
[Page 224, Line 12] Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the 
[Page 224, Line 13] requital for the wrongdoers.  
[Page 224, Line 14] 18. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let 
[Page 224, Line 15] every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of 
[Page 224, Line 16] what you do.  
[Page 224, Line 17] 19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah, 
[Page 224, Line 18] so He made them forget themselves. These 
[Page 224, Line 19] are the sinners.  
[Page 224, Line 20] 20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire 
[Page 224, Line 21] and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in-habitants of Paradise who are the winners.  
[Page 224, Line 22] 21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun-
[Page 224, Line 23] tain, you would have seen it trembling, crum-
[Page 224, Line 24] bling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite 
[Page 224, Line 25] for the people, so that they may reflect.  
[Page 224, Line 26] 22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the 
[Page 224, Line 27] Knower of secrets and declarations. He is  the 
[Page 224, Line 28] Compassionate, the Merciful.  
[Page 224, Line 29] 23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; 
[Page 224, Line 30] the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace -Giver, the 
[Page 224, Line 31] Faith -Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the 
[Page 224, Line 32] Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to 
[Page 224, Line 33] Allah, beyond what they associate.  
[Page 224, Line 34] 24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De-
[Page 224, Line 35] signer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. 
[Page 224, Line 36] Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glo-
[Page 224, Line 37] rifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.  

[Page 224, Line 39] 60. THE WOMAN TESTED  
[Page 224, Line 40] (al-Mumtahina ) 
[Page 224, Line 41] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 224, Line 42] the Gracious, the Merciful  1. O you who believe! Do not take My enemies 
[Page 224, Line 43] and your enemies for supporters, offering 
[Page 224, Line 44] them affection, when they have disbelieved in 
[Page 224, Line 45] what has come to you of the Truth. They have 
[Page 224, Line 46] expelled the Messenger, and you, because you 
[Page 224, Line 47] believed in Allah, your Lord. If y ou have mo-
[Page 224, Line 48] bilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap-
[Page 224, Line 49] proval, how can you secretly love them? I 
[Page 224, Line 50] know what you conceal and what you reveal. 
[Page 224, Line 51] Whoever among you does that has strayed 
[Page 224, Line 52] from the right way.  
[Page 224, Line 53] 2. Whenever they encounter you, they treat 
[Page 224, Line 54] you as enemie s, and they stretch their hands 
[Page 224, Line 55] and tongues against you with malice. They wish that you would disbelieve.  
[Page 224, Line 56] 3. Neither your relatives nor your children 
[Page 224, Line 57] will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. 
[Page 224, Line 58] He will separate between you. Allah is Ob-servant of what you do.  
[Page 224, Line 59] 4. You have had an excellent example in Abra-
[Page 224, Line 60] ham and those with him; when they said to 
[Page 224, Line 61] their people, “We are quit of you, and what you worship apart from Allah. We denounce 
[Page 224, Line 62] you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between 
[Page 224, Line 63] us and you, forever, until you belie ve in Allah 
[Page 224, Line 64] alone.” Except for the words of Abraham to 
[Page 224, Line 65] his father, “I will ask forgiveness for you, 
[Page 224, Line 66] though I have no power from Allah to do an-
[Page 224, Line 67] ything for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust, 
[Page 224, Line 68] and to You we repent, and to You is the ulti-
[Page 224, Line 69] mate resort.  
[Page 224, Line 70] 5. Our Lord,  do not make us a target for those 
[Page 224, Line 71] who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You 
[Page 224, Line 72] are indeed the Mighty and Wise.”  
[Page 224, Line 73] 6. There is an excellent example in them for 
[Page 224, Line 74] you—for anyone who seeks Allah and the 
[Page 224, Line 75] Last Day. But whoever turns away —Allah is 
[Page 224, Line 76] the Self -Suffici ent, the Most Praised.  
[Page 224, Line 77] 7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between 
[Page 224, Line 78] you and those of them you consider enemies. Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
[Page 224, Line 79] ciful.  
[Page 224, Line 80] 8. As for those who have not fought against 
[Page 224, Line 81] you for your religion, nor expelled you from 
[Page 224, Line 82] your homes, Allah does not prohibit you 
[Page 224, Line 83] from dealing with them kindly and equitably. 
[Page 224, Line 84] Allah loves the equitable.  
[Page 224, Line 85] 213 
[Page 225, Line 1] 61.  COLUMN   (as-Saff)  
[Page 225, Line 2] 9. But Allah prohibits you from befriending 
[Page 225, Line 3] those who fought against you over your reli-
[Page 225, Line 4] gion, and expelled you from your homes, and 
[Page 225, Line 5] aided in your ex pulsion. Whoever takes them 
[Page 225, Line 6] for friends —these are the wrongdoers.  
[Page 225, Line 7] 10. O you who believe! When believing 
[Page 225, Line 8] women come to you emigrating, test them. 
[Page 225, Line 9] Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find 
[Page 225, Line 10] them to be faithful, do not send them back to 
[Page 225, Line 11] the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, 
[Page 225, Line 12] nor are they lawful for them. But give them what they have spent. You are not at fault if 
[Page 225, Line 13] you marry them, provided you give them 
[Page 225, Line 14] their compensation. And do not hold on to 
[Page 225, Line 15] ties with unbelieving women, but demand 
[Page 225, Line 16] what you have sp ent, and let them demand 
[Page 225, Line 17] what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; 
[Page 225, Line 18] He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and 
[Page 225, Line 19] Wise.  
[Page 225, Line 20] 11. If any of your wives desert you to the unbe-
[Page 225, Line 21] lievers, and you decide to penalize them, give 
[Page 225, Line 22] those whose wives have gone away the equi v-
[Page 225, Line 23] alent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, 
[Page 225, Line 24] in whom you are believers.  
[Page 225, Line 25] 12. O prophet! If believing women come to 
[Page 225, Line 26] you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition 
[Page 225, Line 27] that they will not associate anything with Al-
[Page 225, Line 28] lah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill 
[Page 225, Line 29] their children, nor commit perjury as to 
[Page 225, Line 30] parenthood, nor disobey you in anything righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Al-
[Page 225, Line 31] lah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 225, Line 32] 13. O you who believe! Do not befriend people 
[Page 225, Line 33] with whom Allah has become  angry, and 
[Page 225, Line 34] have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faith-
[Page 225, Line 35] less have despaired of the occupants of the 
[Page 225, Line 36] graves.

[Page 225, Line 39] (as-Saff) 
[Page 225, Line 40] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 225, Line 41] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 225, Line 42] 1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
[Page 225, Line 43] praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise.  2. O you who believe! Why do you say what 
[Page 225, Line 44] you do not do?  
[Page 225, Line 45] 3. It is most hateful to Allah that you say what 
[Page 225, Line 46] you do not do.  
[Page 225, Line 47] 4. Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in 
[Page 225, Line 48] ranks, as though they were a compact struc-
[Page 225, Line 49] ture.  
[Page 225, Line 50] 5. When Moses said to his people, “O my peo-
[Page 225, Line 51] ple, why do you hurt me, although you know 
[Page 225, Line 52] that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And when they swerved, Allah swerved their 
[Page 225, Line 53] hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.  
[Page 225, Line 54] 6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Chil-
[Page 225, Line 55] dren of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah, 
[Page 225, Line 56] and announcing good news of a messenger 
[Page 225, Line 57] who will come after me, whose name is Ah-
[Page 225, Line 58] mad.” But when he showed them the mira-
[Page 225, Line 59] cles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”  
[Page 225, Line 60] 7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he 
[Page 225, Line 61] who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he 
[Page 225, Line 62] is being invited to Islam? Allah does not 
[Page 225, Line 63] guide the wrongdoing people.  
[Page 225, Line 64] 8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with 
[Page 225, Line 65] their mouths; but Allah will complete His 
[Page 225, Line 66] Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.  
[Page 225, Line 67] 9. It is He who sent His Messenger with the 
[Page 225, Line 68] guidance and the true religion, to make it 
[Page 225, Line 69] prevail over all religions, even though the 
[Page 225, Line 70] idolaters dislike it.  
[Page 225, Line 71] 10. O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a 
[Page 225, Line 72] trade that will save you f rom a painful tor-
[Page 225, Line 73] ment?  
[Page 225, Line 74] 11. That you believe in Allah and His Messen-
[Page 225, Line 75] ger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your 
[Page 225, Line 76] possessions and yourselves. That is best for 
[Page 225, Line 77] you, if you only knew.  
[Page 225, Line 78] 12. He will forgive you your sins; and will ad-
[Page 225, Line 79] mit you into gardens beneat h which rivers 
[Page 225, Line 80] flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gar-dens of Eden. That is the supreme success.  
[Page 225, Line 81] 13. And something else you love: support from 
[Page 225, Line 82] Allah, and imminent victory. So give good 
[Page 225, Line 83] news to the believers.  
[Page 225, Line 84] 214 
[Page 226, Line 1] 62.  FRIDAY   (al-Jumu’ah)  
[Page 226, Line 2] 14. O you who believe! Be supporters of All ah, 
[Page 226, Line 3] as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, 
[Page 226, Line 4] “Who are my supporters towards Allah?” 
[Page 226, Line 5] The disciples said, “We are Allah's support-
[Page 226, Line 6] ers.” So a group of the Children of Israel be-
[Page 226, Line 7] lieved, while another group disbelieved. We 
[Page 226, Line 8] supported those who believed against their 
[Page 226, Line 9] foe, so they became dominant.  

[Page 226, Line 11] 62. FRIDAY 
[Page 226, Line 12] (al-Jumu’ah ) 
[Page 226, Line 13] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 226, Line 14] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 226, Line 15] 1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo-
[Page 226, Line 16] rifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al-
[Page 226, Line 17] mighty, the Wise.  
[Page 226, Line 18] 2. It is He who sent among the unlett ered a 
[Page 226, Line 19] messenger from themselves; reciting His rev-elations to them, and purifying them, and 
[Page 226, Line 20] teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt-
[Page 226, Line 21] hough they were in obvious error before that.  
[Page 226, Line 22] 3. And others from them, who have not yet 
[Page 226, Line 23] joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.  
[Page 226, Line 24] 4. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to 
[Page 226, Line 25] whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim-
[Page 226, Line 26] itless grace.  
[Page 226, Line 27] 5. The example of those who were entrusted 
[Page 226, Line 28] with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, 
[Page 226, Line 29] is like the donkey carrying works of litera-
[Page 226, Line 30] ture. Miser able is the example of the people 
[Page 226, Line 31] who denounce Allah’s revelations. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.  
[Page 226, Line 32] 6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you 
[Page 226, Line 33] claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu-
[Page 226, Line 34] sion of the rest of mankind, then wish for 
[Page 226, Line 35] death if you a re sincere.”  
[Page 226, Line 36] 7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to 
[Page 226, Line 37] what their hands have advanced. Allah knows 
[Page 226, Line 38] well the wrongdoers.  
[Page 226, Line 39] 8. Say, “The death from which you flee will 
[Page 226, Line 40] catch up with you; then you will be returned 
[Page 226, Line 41] to the Knower of the Invisible and the Vis ible, 
[Page 226, Line 42] and He will inform you of what you used to 
[Page 226, Line 43] do.” 9. O you who believe! When the call is made 
[Page 226, Line 44] for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to 
[Page 226, Line 45] the remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi-
[Page 226, Line 46] ness. That is better for you, if you only knew.  
[Page 226, Line 47] 10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis-
[Page 226, Line 48] perse through the land, and seek Allah’s 
[Page 226, Line 49] bounty, and remember Allah much, so that 
[Page 226, Line 50] you may prosper.  
[Page 226, Line 51] 11. Yet whenever they come across some busi-
[Page 226, Line 52] ness, or some entertainment, they scramble 
[Page 226, Line 53] towards it, and leave you standi ng. Say, 
[Page 226, Line 54] “What is with Allah is better than entertain-
[Page 226, Line 55] ment and business; and Allah is the Best of 
[Page 226, Line 56] providers.”  

[Page 226, Line 58] 63. THE HYPOCRITES  
[Page 226, Line 59] (al-Munafiqun)  
[Page 226, Line 60] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 226, Line 61] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 226, Line 62] 1. When the hypocrites come to you, they say, 
[Page 226, Line 63] “We bear witness  that you are Allah’s Mes-
[Page 226, Line 64] senger.” Allah knows that you are His Mes-senger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp-
[Page 226, Line 65] ocrites are liars.  
[Page 226, Line 66] 2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they 
[Page 226, Line 67] repel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what 
[Page 226, Line 68] they do.  
[Page 226, Line 69] 3. That is because they  believed, and then dis-
[Page 226, Line 70] believed; so their hearts were sealed, and they 
[Page 226, Line 71] cannot understand.  
[Page 226, Line 72] 4. When you see them, their appearance im-
[Page 226, Line 73] presses you. And when they speak, you listen 
[Page 226, Line 74] to what they say. They are like propped -up 
[Page 226, Line 75] timber. They think every shout is aim ed at 
[Page 226, Line 76] them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. 
[Page 226, Line 77] Allah condemns them; how deluded they are!  
[Page 226, Line 78] 5. And when it is said to them, “Come, the 
[Page 226, Line 79] Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for 
[Page 226, Line 80] you,” they bend their heads, and you see them 
[Page 226, Line 81] turning away arrogantly.  
[Page 226, Line 82] 6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for-
[Page 226, Line 83] giveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness 
[Page 226, Line 84] for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah 
[Page 226, Line 85] does not guide the sinful people.  
[Page 226, Line 86] 215 
[Page 227, Line 1] 64.  GATHERING   (at-Taghabun)  
[Page 227, Line 2] 7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything 
[Page 227, Line 3] on those who side with Allah’s Messenger, 
[Page 227, Line 4] unless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong 
[Page 227, Line 5] the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but 
[Page 227, Line 6] the hypocrites do not understand.  
[Page 227, Line 7] 8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more 
[Page 227, Line 8] powerful therein will evict the weak.” But 
[Page 227, Line 9] power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, 
[Page 227, Line 10] and the believers; but the hypocrites do not know.  
[Page 227, Line 11] 9. O you who believe! Let neither your posses-
[Page 227, Line 12] sions nor your children distract you from the 
[Page 227, Line 13] remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that—
[Page 227, Line 14] these are the losers.  
[Page 227, Line 15] 10. And give from what We have provided for 
[Page 227, Line 16] you, before death approaches one of you, and 
[Page 227, Line 17] he says, “My Lord, if only You would delay 
[Page 227, Line 18] me for a short while, so that I may be charita-
[Page 227, Line 19] ble, and be one of the righteous.”  
[Page 227, Line 20] 11. But Allah will not delay a soul when its time 
[Page 227, Line 21] has come. Allah is Informed of what you do.  

[Page 227, Line 23] 64. GATHERING  
[Page 227, Line 24] (at-Taghabun ) 
[Page 227, Line 25] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 227, Line 26] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 227, Line 27] 1. Everything in the heavens and the earth 
[Page 227, Line 28] praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, 
[Page 227, Line 29] and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able 
[Page 227, Line 30] to do all things.  
[Page 227, Line 31] 2. It is He who created you. Some of you are 
[Page 227, Line 32] unbelievers, and some of you are believers. 
[Page 227, Line 33] And Allah perceives what you do.  
[Page 227, Line 34] 3. He created the heavens and the earth with 
[Page 227, Line 35] truth, and He designed you, and designed 
[Page 227, Line 36] you well, and to Him is the final return.  
[Page 227, Line 37] 4. He knows everything in the heavens and the 
[Page 227, Line 38] earth, and He knows what you conceal and 
[Page 227, Line 39] what you reveal. And Allah knows what is 
[Page 227, Line 40] within the hearts.  
[Page 227, Line 41] 5. Has the news not reached you, of those who 
[Page 227, Line 42] disbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse-
[Page 227, Line 43] quences of their conduct, and a painful tor-
[Page 227, Line 44] ment awaits them.  6. That is because their messengers came to 
[Page 227, Line 45] them with clear explanations, but they said, 
[Page 227, Line 46] “Are human beings going to guide us?” So 
[Page 227, Line 47] they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah 
[Page 227, Line 48] is in no need. Allah is Independent and 
[Page 227, Line 49] Praiseworthy.  
[Page 227, Line 50] 7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will 
[Page 227, Line 51] not be resurrected. Say, “Yes indeed, by my 
[Page 227, Line 52] Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be 
[Page 227, Line 53] informed of everything you did; and that is 
[Page 227, Line 54] easy for Allah.”  
[Page 227, Line 55] 8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and 
[Page 227, Line 56] the Light which We sent d own. Allah is 
[Page 227, Line 57] Aware of everything you do.  
[Page 227, Line 58] 9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day 
[Page 227, Line 59] of Gathering —that is the Day of Mutual Ex-
[Page 227, Line 60] change. Whoever believes in Allah and acts 
[Page 227, Line 61] with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, 
[Page 227, Line 62] and will admit him into gardens beneath 
[Page 227, Line 63] which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. 
[Page 227, Line 64] That is the supreme achievement.  
[Page 227, Line 65] 10. But as for those who disbelieve and de-
[Page 227, Line 66] nounce Our revelations —these are the in-
[Page 227, Line 67] mates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; 
[Page 227, Line 68] and what a miserable fate!  
[Page 227, Line 69] 11. No disaster occurs excep t by Allah’s leave. 
[Page 227, Line 70] Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his 
[Page 227, Line 71] heart. Allah is Aware of everything.  
[Page 227, Line 72] 12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But 
[Page 227, Line 73] if you turn away —it is only incumbent on 
[Page 227, Line 74] Our Messenger to deliver the clear message.  
[Page 227, Line 75] 13. Allah, there is no god  but He; and in Allah 
[Page 227, Line 76] let the believers put their trust.  
[Page 227, Line 77] 14. O you who believe! Among your wives and 
[Page 227, Line 78] your children are enemies to you, so beware 
[Page 227, Line 79] of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and 
[Page 227, Line 80] forgive —Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.  
[Page 227, Line 81] 15. Your possessions and your children are a 
[Page 227, Line 82] test, but with Allah is a splendid reward.  
[Page 227, Line 83] 16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you 
[Page 227, Line 84] can, and listen, and obey, and give for your 
[Page 227, Line 85] own good. He who is protected from his stin-
[Page 227, Line 86] giness —these are the prosperous.  
[Page 227, Line 87] 216 
[Page 228, Line 1] 65.  DIVORCE   (at-Talaq)  
[Page 228, Line 2] 17. If you lend Allah a good  loan, He will mul-
[Page 228, Line 3] tiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is 
[Page 228, Line 4] Appreciative and Forbearing.  
[Page 228, Line 5] 18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, 
[Page 228, Line 6] the Almighty, the Wise.  

[Page 228, Line 8] 65. DIVORCE  
[Page 228, Line 9] (at-Talaq ) 
[Page 228, Line 10] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 228, Line 11] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 228, Line 12] 1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di-
[Page 228, Line 13] vorce them during their period of purity, and 
[Page 228, Line 14] calculate their term. And be pious before Al-
[Page 228, Line 15] lah, your Lord. And do not evict them from 
[Page 228, Line 16] their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they 
[Page 228, Line 17] have committed a proven adultery. These are 
[Page 228, Line 18] the limits of Allah —whoever oversteps Al-
[Page 228, Line 19] lah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You 
[Page 228, Line 20] never know; Allah may afterwards bring 
[Page 228, Line 21] about a new situation.  
[Page 228, Line 22] 2. Once they have reached their term, either 
[Page 228, Line 23] retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to wi tness two just 
[Page 228, Line 24] people from among you, and give upright tes-timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever 
[Page 228, Line 25] believes in Allah and the Last Day. And who-
[Page 228, Line 26] ever fears Allah —He will make a way out for 
[Page 228, Line 27] him.  
[Page 228, Line 28] 3. And will provide for him from where he 
[Page 228, Line 29] never expected. Wh oever relies on Allah —
[Page 228, Line 30] He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His 
[Page 228, Line 31] purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.  
[Page 228, Line 32] 4. As for those of your women who have 
[Page 228, Line 33] reached menopause, if you have any doubts, 
[Page 228, Line 34] their term shall be three months —and also 
[Page 228, Line 35] for those who have not menstruated. As for 
[Page 228, Line 36] those who are pregnant, their term shall be 
[Page 228, Line 37] until they have delivered. Whoever fears Al-
[Page 228, Line 38] lah—He will make things easy for him.  
[Page 228, Line 39] 5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He 
[Page 228, Line 40] sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah— He 
[Page 228, Line 41] will remit his sin s, and will amplify his re-
[Page 228, Line 42] ward.  
[Page 228, Line 43] 6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac-
[Page 228, Line 44] cording to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for 
[Page 228, Line 45] them. If they are pregnant, spend on them 
[Page 228, Line 46] until they give birth. And if they nurse your 
[Page 228, Line 47] infant, give them their payment. And con-
[Page 228, Line 48] duct your relation in amity. But if you disa-gree, then let another woman nurse him.  
[Page 228, Line 49] 7. The wealthy shall spend according to his 
[Page 228, Line 50] means; and he whose resources are restricted 
[Page 228, Line 51] shall spend according to what Allah has given 
[Page 228, Line 52] him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what 
[Page 228, Line 53] He has given it. Allah will bring ease after 
[Page 228, Line 54] hardship.  
[Page 228, Line 55] 8. How many a town defied the command of 
[Page 228, Line 56] its Lord and His messengers? So We held it 
[Page 228, Line 57] strictly accountable, and We punished it with 
[Page 228, Line 58] a dreadful punishment.  
[Page 228, Line 59] 9. It tas ted the result of its decisions, and the 
[Page 228, Line 60] outcome of its decisions was perdition.  
[Page 228, Line 61] 10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri-
[Page 228, Line 62] bution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos-
[Page 228, Line 63] sess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent 
[Page 228, Line 64] down to you a Reminder.  
[Page 228, Line 65] 11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s 
[Page 228, Line 66] Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring 
[Page 228, Line 67] those who believe and work righteousness 
[Page 228, Line 68] from darkness into light. Whoever believes in 
[Page 228, Line 69] Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit 
[Page 228, Line 70] him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, 
[Page 228, Line 71] therein  to abide forever. Allah has given him 
[Page 228, Line 72] an excellent provision.  
[Page 228, Line 73] 12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens, 
[Page 228, Line 74] and their like of earth. The command de-
[Page 228, Line 75] scends through them, so that you may know 
[Page 228, Line 76] that Allah is Capable of everything, and that 
[Page 228, Line 77] Allah Encompasses every thing in knowledge.  

[Page 228, Line 79] 66. PROHIBITION  
[Page 228, Line 80] (at-Tahrim ) 
[Page 228, Line 81] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 228, Line 82] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 228, Line 83] 1. O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah 
[Page 228, Line 84] has permitted for you, seeking to please your 
[Page 228, Line 85] wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  
[Page 228, Line 86] 217 
[Page 229, Line 1] 67.  SOVEREIGNTY   (al-Mulk)  
[Page 229, Line 2] 2. Allah has decreed for y ou the dissolution of 
[Page 229, Line 3] your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the 
[Page 229, Line 4] All-Knowing, the Most Wise.  
[Page 229, Line 5] 3. The Prophet told something in confidence 
[Page 229, Line 6] to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, 
[Page 229, Line 7] and Allah made it known to him; he commu-
[Page 229, Line 8] nicated part of it, and he avo ided another 
[Page 229, Line 9] part. Then, when he informed her of it, she 
[Page 229, Line 10] said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, 
[Page 229, Line 11] “The All -Knowing, the All -Informed, in-
[Page 229, Line 12] formed me.”  
[Page 229, Line 13] 4. If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have 
[Page 229, Line 14] listened. But if you band together against him, then Alla h is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and 
[Page 229, Line 15] the righteous believers. In addition, the an-
[Page 229, Line 16] gels will assist him.  
[Page 229, Line 17] 5. Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will 
[Page 229, Line 18] give him in exchange wives better than you: 
[Page 229, Line 19] submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de-
[Page 229, Line 20] vout, fasting —previou sly married, or virgins.  
[Page 229, Line 21] 6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and 
[Page 229, Line 22] your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people 
[Page 229, Line 23] and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow-erful. They never disobey Allah in anything 
[Page 229, Line 24] He commands them, and they carry out 
[Page 229, Line 25] whatever they are commanded.  
[Page 229, Line 26] 7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses 
[Page 229, Line 27] today. You are being repaid for what you 
[Page 229, Line 28] used to do.  
[Page 229, Line 29] 8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with 
[Page 229, Line 30] sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens 
[Page 229, Line 31] beneath which  rivers flow, on the Day when 
[Page 229, Line 32] Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and 
[Page 229, Line 33] those who believed with him. Their light 
[Page 229, Line 34] streaming before them, and to their right, 
[Page 229, Line 35] they will say, “Our Lord, complete our light for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all 
[Page 229, Line 36] things.”  
[Page 229, Line 37] 9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe-
[Page 229, Line 38] lievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable 
[Page 229, Line 39] destination!  
[Page 229, Line 40] 10. Allah illustrates an example of those who 
[Page 229, Line 41] disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of 
[Page 229, Line 42] Lot. They were und er two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. They 
[Page 229, Line 43] availed them nothing against Allah, and it 
[Page 229, Line 44] was said, “Enter the Fire with those who are 
[Page 229, Line 45] entering.”  
[Page 229, Line 46] 11. And Allah illustrates an example of those 
[Page 229, Line 47] who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she 
[Page 229, Line 48] said,  “My Lord, build for me, with you, a 
[Page 229, Line 49] house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh 
[Page 229, Line 50] and his works, and save me from the wrong-
[Page 229, Line 51] doing people.”  
[Page 229, Line 52] 12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who 
[Page 229, Line 53] guarded her womb, and so We breathed into 
[Page 229, Line 54] her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the 
[Page 229, Line 55] truth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and 
[Page 229, Line 56] was one of the devout.  

[Page 229, Line 58] 67. SOVEREIGNTY  
[Page 229, Line 59] (al-Mulk ) 
[Page 229, Line 60] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 229, Line 61] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 229, Line 62] 1. Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover-
[Page 229, Line 63] eignty, and Who has power over everything.  
[Page 229, Line 64] 2. He who created death and life —to test 
[Page 229, Line 65] you—as to which of you is better in conduct. 
[Page 229, Line 66] He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.  
[Page 229, Line 67] 3. He who created seven heavens in layers. 
[Page 229, Line 68] You see no discrepancy in the creation of the 
[Page 229, Line 69] Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any 
[Page 229, Line 70] cracks?  
[Page 229, Line 71] 4. Then look again, and again, and your sight 
[Page 229, Line 72] will return to you dazzled and exhausted.  
[Page 229, Line 73] 5. We have adorned the lower heaven with 
[Page 229, Line 74] lanterns, and made them missiles against the 
[Page 229, Line 75] devils; and We have prepared for them the 
[Page 229, Line 76] punishment of the Blaze.  
[Page 229, Line 77] 6. For those who reject thei r Lord, there is the 
[Page 229, Line 78] torment of Hell. What an evil destination!  
[Page 229, Line 79] 7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear 
[Page 229, Line 80] it roaring, as it seethes.  
[Page 229, Line 81] 8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a 
[Page 229, Line 82] batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask 
[Page 229, Line 83] them, “Has no warner come t o you?”  
[Page 229, Line 84] 218 
[Page 230, Line 1] 68.  THE PEN   (al-Qalam)  
[Page 230, Line 2] 9. They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, 
[Page 230, Line 3] but we disbelieved, and said, ‘Allah did not 
[Page 230, Line 4] send down anything; you are very much mis-
[Page 230, Line 5] taken.’”  
[Page 230, Line 6] 10. And they will say, “Had we listened or rea-
[Page 230, Line 7] soned, we would not have been among the in-
[Page 230, Line 8] mates of the Blaze.”  
[Page 230, Line 9] 11. So they will acknowledge their sins. So 
[Page 230, Line 10] away with the inmates of the Blaze.  
[Page 230, Line 11] 12. As for those who fear their Lord in secret—
[Page 230, Line 12] for them is forgiveness and a great reward.  
[Page 230, Line 13] 13. Whether you keep your words secret, or 
[Page 230, Line 14] declare them —He is Aware of the inner  
[Page 230, Line 15] thoughts.  
[Page 230, Line 16] 14. Would He not know, He Who created? He 
[Page 230, Line 17] is the Refined, the Expert.  
[Page 230, Line 18] 15. It is He who made the earth manageable for 
[Page 230, Line 19] you, so travel its regions, and eat of His pro-
[Page 230, Line 20] visions. To Him is the Resurgence.  
[Page 230, Line 21] 16. Are you confident that the One in heaven 
[Page 230, Line 22] will not cause the earth to collapse beneath 
[Page 230, Line 23] you as it spins?  
[Page 230, Line 24] 17. Or are you confident that the One in 
[Page 230, Line 25] Heaven will not unleash against you a violent 
[Page 230, Line 26] storm? Then you will know what My warning 
[Page 230, Line 27] is like.  
[Page 230, Line 28] 18. Those before them also denied the truth; 
[Page 230, Line 29] and how was M y disapproval?  
[Page 230, Line 30] 19. Have they not seen the birds above them, 
[Page 230, Line 31] spreading their wings, and folding them? 
[Page 230, Line 32] None holds them except the Compassionate. 
[Page 230, Line 33] He is Perceiver of everything.  
[Page 230, Line 34] 20. Or who is this who is a force for you to pro-
[Page 230, Line 35] tect you against the Compassionate ? The dis-
[Page 230, Line 36] believers are in nothing but delusion.  
[Page 230, Line 37] 21. Or who is this that will provide for you, if 
[Page 230, Line 38] He withholds His provision? Yet they persist 
[Page 230, Line 39] in defiance and aversion.  
[Page 230, Line 40] 22. Is he who walks bent on his own design 
[Page 230, Line 41] better guided, or he who walks upright on a 
[Page 230, Line 42] straight path?  
[Page 230, Line 43] 23. Say, “It is He who produced you; and made 
[Page 230, Line 44] for you the hearing, and the vision, and the 
[Page 230, Line 45] organs. But rarely do you give thanks.”  24. Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth, 
[Page 230, Line 46] and to Him you will be rounded up.”  
[Page 230, Line 47] 25. And they say, “When will  this promise be 
[Page 230, Line 48] fulfilled, if you are truthful?”  
[Page 230, Line 49] 26. Say, “Knowledge is with Allah, and I am 
[Page 230, Line 50] only a clear warner.”  
[Page 230, Line 51] 27. But when they see it approaching, the faces 
[Page 230, Line 52] of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, 
[Page 230, Line 53] and it will be said, “This is what you used to 
[Page 230, Line 54] call for.”  
[Page 230, Line 55] 28. Say, “Have you considered? Should Allah 
[Page 230, Line 56] make me perish, and those with me; or else 
[Page 230, Line 57] He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect 
[Page 230, Line 58] the disbelievers from an agonizing torment?”  
[Page 230, Line 59] 29. Say, “He is the Compassionate. We have 
[Page 230, Line 60] faith in Him, and in Him we  trust. Soon you 
[Page 230, Line 61] will know who is in evident error.”  
[Page 230, Line 62] 30. Say, “Have you considered? If your water 
[Page 230, Line 63] drains away, who will bring you pure running water?”  

[Page 230, Line 65] 68. THE PEN  
[Page 230, Line 66] (al-Qalam ) 
[Page 230, Line 67] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 230, Line 68] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 230, Line 69] 1. Noon. By the pen, and by what they in-
[Page 230, Line 70] scribe.  
[Page 230, Line 71] 2. By the grace of your Lord, you are not in-
[Page 230, Line 72] sane.  
[Page 230, Line 73] 3. In fact, you will have a reward that will 
[Page 230, Line 74] never end.  
[Page 230, Line 75] 4. And you are of a great moral character.  
[Page 230, Line 76] 5. You will see, and they will see.  
[Page 230, Line 77] 6. Which of you is the afflicted.  
[Page 230, Line 78] 7. Your Lord know s best who has strayed from 
[Page 230, Line 79] His path, and He knows best the well -guided.  
[Page 230, Line 80] 8. So do not obey the deniers.  
[Page 230, Line 81] 9. They would like you to compromise, so they 
[Page 230, Line 82] would compromise.  
[Page 230, Line 83] 10. And do not obey any vile swearer.  
[Page 230, Line 84] 11. Backbiter, spreader of slander.  
[Page 230, Line 85] 219 
[Page 231, Line 1] 68.  THE PEN   (al-Qalam)  
[Page 231, Line 2] 12. Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner.  
[Page 231, Line 3] 13. Rude and fake besides.  
[Page 231, Line 4] 14. Just because he has money and children.  
[Page 231, Line 5] 15. When Our Verses are recited to him, he 
[Page 231, Line 6] says, “Myths of the ancients!”  
[Page 231, Line 7] 16. We will brand him on the muzzle.  
[Page 231, Line 8] 17. We tested them, as We tested the owners  of 
[Page 231, Line 9] the garden, when they vowed to harvest it in 
[Page 231, Line 10] the morning.  
[Page 231, Line 11] 18. Without any reservation.  
[Page 231, Line 12] 19. But a calamity from your Lord went 
[Page 231, Line 13] around it while they slept.  
[Page 231, Line 14] 20. And in the morning it was as if picked.  
[Page 231, Line 15] 21. In the morning, they called to one another.  
[Page 231, Line 16] 22. “Go early to your plantation, if you are go-
[Page 231, Line 17] ing to harvest.”  
[Page 231, Line 18] 23. So off they went, murmuring to one an-
[Page 231, Line 19] other.  
[Page 231, Line 20] 24. “No poor person is to enter it upon you to-
[Page 231, Line 21] day.”  
[Page 231, Line 22] 25. And early they went, resolved in intent.  
[Page 231, Line 23] 26. But when they saw it, they said, “We were 
[Page 231, Line 24] wrong.  
[Page 231, Line 25] 27. We are now deprived.”  
[Page 231, Line 26] 28. The most reasonable of them said, “Did I 
[Page 231, Line 27] not say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’”  
[Page 231, Line 28] 29. They said, “Glory to our Lord —We were 
[Page 231, Line 29] indeed in the wrong.”  
[Page 231, Line 30] 30. Then they turned to one another, blaming 
[Page 231, Line 31] one another.  
[Page 231, Line 32] 31. They said, “W oe to us —we were indeed 
[Page 231, Line 33] domineering.  
[Page 231, Line 34] 32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better sub-
[Page 231, Line 35] stitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.”  
[Page 231, Line 36] 33. Such is the punishment; but the punish-
[Page 231, Line 37] ment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.  
[Page 231, Line 38] 34. For the righteous are Gardens  of Delight 
[Page 231, Line 39] with their Lord.  
[Page 231, Line 40] 35. Shall We treat the Muslims like the vil-
[Page 231, Line 41] lains?  36. What is the matter with you? How do you 
[Page 231, Line 42] judge?  
[Page 231, Line 43] 37. Or do you have a scripture in which you 
[Page 231, Line 44] study.  
[Page 231, Line 45] 38. Wherein there is whatever you choose?  
[Page 231, Line 46] 39. Or do you have oaths from Us,  binding un-
[Page 231, Line 47] til the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand?  
[Page 231, Line 48] 40. Ask them, which of them will guarantee 
[Page 231, Line 49] that.  
[Page 231, Line 50] 41. Or do they have partners? Then let them 
[Page 231, Line 51] produce their partners, if they are truthful.  
[Page 231, Line 52] 42. On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, 
[Page 231, Line 53] and they will be called to bow down, but they 
[Page 231, Line 54] will be unable.  
[Page 231, Line 55] 43. Their eyes subdued, shame will cover 
[Page 231, Line 56] them. They were invited to bow down when 
[Page 231, Line 57] they were sound.  
[Page 231, Line 58] 44. So leave Me to those who reject this dis-
[Page 231, Line 59] course; We will proceed against them gradu-ally, from where they do not know.  
[Page 231, Line 60] 45. And I will give them respite. My plan is 
[Page 231, Line 61] firm.  
[Page 231, Line 62] 46. Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are 
[Page 231, Line 63] burdened with debt?  
[Page 231, Line 64] 47. Or do they know the future, and so they 
[Page 231, Line 65] write it down?  
[Page 231, Line 66] 48. So wait patiently for the Decision of you r 
[Page 231, Line 67] Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish 
[Page 231, Line 68] who cried out in despair.  
[Page 231, Line 69] 49. Were it not for his Lord’s favor that 
[Page 231, Line 70] reached him, he would have been thrown 
[Page 231, Line 71] into the wilderness, fully despised.  
[Page 231, Line 72] 50. But his Lord chose him, and made him one 
[Page 231, Line 73] of the righteous.  
[Page 231, Line 74] 51. Those who disbelieve almost stab you with 
[Page 231, Line 75] their glances when they hear the message, and say, “He is crazy!”  
[Page 231, Line 76] 52. But it is no less than a reminder to all the 
[Page 231, Line 77] Worlds.  

[Page 231, Line 79] 220 
[Page 232, Line 1] 69.  THE REALITY   (al-Haqqah)  
[Page 232, Line 2] 69. THE REALITY  
[Page 232, Line 3] (al-Haqqah ) 
[Page 232, Line 4] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 232, Line 5] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 232, Line 6] 1. The Reality.  
[Page 232, Line 7] 2. What is the Reality?  
[Page 232, Line 8] 3. What will make you understand what the 
[Page 232, Line 9] Reality is?  
[Page 232, Line 10] 4. Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe.  
[Page 232, Line 11] 5. As for Thamood, they were annihilated by 
[Page 232, Line 12] the Overwhelming.  
[Page 232, Line 13] 6. And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a 
[Page 232, Line 14] furious, roaring w ind. 
[Page 232, Line 15] 7. He unleashed it upon them for seven nights 
[Page 232, Line 16] and eight days, in succession. You could see 
[Page 232, Line 17] the people tossed around, as though they 
[Page 232, Line 18] were stumps of hollow palm -trees.  
[Page 232, Line 19] 8. Can you see any remnant of them?  
[Page 232, Line 20] 9. Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, 
[Page 232, Line 21] and t he Overturned Cities steeped in sin.  
[Page 232, Line 22] 10. But they disobeyed the messenger of their 
[Page 232, Line 23] Lord, so He seized them with an overpower-
[Page 232, Line 24] ing grip.  
[Page 232, Line 25] 11. When the waters overflowed, We carried 
[Page 232, Line 26] you in the cruising ship.  
[Page 232, Line 27] 12. To make it a lesson for you —so that retain-
[Page 232, Line 28] ing ear s may retain it.  
[Page 232, Line 29] 13. Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a sin-
[Page 232, Line 30] gle time.  
[Page 232, Line 31] 14. And the earth and the mountains are lifted 
[Page 232, Line 32] up, and crushed, with a single crush.  
[Page 232, Line 33] 15. On that Day, the Event will come to pass.  
[Page 232, Line 34] 16. And the heaven will crack; so on that Day 
[Page 232, Line 35] it will  be frail.  
[Page 232, Line 36] 17. And the angels will be ranged around its 
[Page 232, Line 37] borders, while eight will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day.  
[Page 232, Line 38] 18. On that Day you will be exposed, and no 
[Page 232, Line 39] secret of yours will remain hidden.  19. As for him who is given his book in his 
[Page 232, Line 40] right hand, he will say, “Here, take my book 
[Page 232, Line 41] and read it.  
[Page 232, Line 42] 20. I knew I would be held accountable.”  
[Page 232, Line 43] 21. So he will be in pleasant living.  
[Page 232, Line 44] 22. In a lofty Garden.  
[Page 232, Line 45] 23. Its pickings are within reach.  
[Page 232, Line 46] 24. “Eat and drink merrily for what you did in 
[Page 232, Line 47] the days gone by.”  
[Page 232, Line 48] 25. But as for him who is given his book in his 
[Page 232, Line 49] left hand, he will say, “I wish I was never 
[Page 232, Line 50] given my book.  
[Page 232, Line 51] 26. And never knew what my account was.  
[Page 232, Line 52] 27. If only it was the end.  
[Page 232, Line 53] 28. My money cannot avail me.  
[Page 232, Line 54] 29. My power has vanished from me.”  
[Page 232, Line 55] 30. “Take him and shackle him.  
[Page 232, Line 56] 31. Then scorch him in the Blaze.  
[Page 232, Line 57] 32. Then in a chain which length is seventy cu-
[Page 232, Line 58] bits tie him up.  
[Page 232, Line 59] 33. For he would not believe in Allah the 
[Page 232, Line 60] Great.  
[Page 232, Line 61] 34. Nor would he advocate the feeding of the 
[Page 232, Line 62] destitute.  
[Page 232, Line 63] 35. So he has no friend  here today.  
[Page 232, Line 64] 36. And no food except scum.  
[Page 232, Line 65] 37. Which only the sinners eat.”  
[Page 232, Line 66] 38. Indeed, I swear by what you see.  
[Page 232, Line 67] 39. And by what you do not see.  
[Page 232, Line 68] 40. It is the speech of a noble messenger.  
[Page 232, Line 69] 41. And it is not the speech of a poet— little do 
[Page 232, Line 70] you believe.  
[Page 232, Line 71] 42. Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer —little 
[Page 232, Line 72] do you take heed.  
[Page 232, Line 73] 43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the 
[Page 232, Line 74] Worlds.  
[Page 232, Line 75] 44. Had he falsely attributed some statements 
[Page 232, Line 76] to Us.  
[Page 232, Line 77] 45. We would have seized him by the right 
[Page 232, Line 78] arm.  
[Page 232, Line 79] 221 
[Page 233, Line 1] 70.  WAYS OF ASCENT   (al-Ma’arij)  
[Page 233, Line 2] 46. Then slashed his lifeline.  
[Page 233, Line 3] 47. And none o f you could have restrained Us 
[Page 233, Line 4] from him.  
[Page 233, Line 5] 48. Surely, it is a message for the righteous.  
[Page 233, Line 6] 49. And We know that some of you will reject 
[Page 233, Line 7] it. 
[Page 233, Line 8] 50. And it is surely a source of grief for the un-
[Page 233, Line 9] believers.  
[Page 233, Line 10] 51. Yet it is the absolute truth.  
[Page 233, Line 11] 52. So glorify the name of your Lord, the Mag-
[Page 233, Line 12] nificent.  

[Page 233, Line 14] 70. WAYS OF ASCENT  
[Page 233, Line 15] (al-Ma’arij ) 
[Page 233, Line 16] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 233, Line 17] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 233, Line 18] 1. A questioner questioned the imminent tor-
[Page 233, Line 19] ment.  
[Page 233, Line 20] 2. For the disbelievers; none can repel it.  
[Page 233, Line 21] 3. From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.  
[Page 233, Line 22] 4. Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend 
[Page 233, Line 23] on a Day the duration of which is fifty thou-
[Page 233, Line 24] sand years.  
[Page 233, Line 25] 5. So be patient, with sweet patience.  
[Page 233, Line 26] 6. They see it distant.  
[Page 233, Line 27] 7. But We see it near.  
[Page 233, Line 28] 8. On the Day when the sky will be like molten 
[Page 233, Line 29] brass.  
[Page 233, Line 30] 9. And the mountai ns will be like tufted wool.  
[Page 233, Line 31] 10. No friend will care about his friend.  
[Page 233, Line 32] 11. They will be shown each other. The crimi-
[Page 233, Line 33] nal wishes he would be redeemed from the 
[Page 233, Line 34] punishment of that Day by his children.  
[Page 233, Line 35] 12. And his spouse, and his brother.  
[Page 233, Line 36] 13. And his family that  sheltered him.  
[Page 233, Line 37] 14. And everyone on earth, in order to save 
[Page 233, Line 38] him.  
[Page 233, Line 39] 15.  By no means! It is a Raging Fire.  
[Page 233, Line 40] 16. It strips away the scalps.  17. It invites him who once turned his back 
[Page 233, Line 41] and fled.  
[Page 233, Line 42] 18. And accumulated and hoarded.  
[Page 233, Line 43] 19. Man was created restless.  
[Page 233, Line 44] 20. Touched by adversity, he is fretful.  
[Page 233, Line 45] 21. Touched by good, he is ungenerous.  
[Page 233, Line 46] 22. Except the prayerful.  
[Page 233, Line 47] 23. Those who are constant at their prayers.  
[Page 233, Line 48] 24. And those in whose wealth is a rightful 
[Page 233, Line 49] share.  
[Page 233, Line 50] 25. For the beggar and the deprived.  
[Page 233, Line 51] 26. And those who affirm the Day of Judg-
[Page 233, Line 52] ment.  
[Page 233, Line 53] 27. And those who fear the punishment of 
[Page 233, Line 54] their Lord.  
[Page 233, Line 55] 28. Their Lord’s punishment is not to be taken 
[Page 233, Line 56] for granted.  
[Page 233, Line 57] 29. And those who guard their chastity.  
[Page 233, Line 58] 30. Except from their spouses or those living 
[Page 233, Line 59] under their control, for then  they are free of 
[Page 233, Line 60] blame.  
[Page 233, Line 61] 31. But whoever seeks to go beyond that—
[Page 233, Line 62] these are the transgressors.  
[Page 233, Line 63] 32. And those who honor their trusts and their 
[Page 233, Line 64] pledges.  
[Page 233, Line 65] 33. And those who stand by their testimonies.  
[Page 233, Line 66] 34. And those who are dedicated to their pray-
[Page 233, Line 67] ers. 
[Page 233, Line 68] 35. These will be honored in Gardens.  
[Page 233, Line 69] 36. What is with those who disbelieve, stretch-
[Page 233, Line 70] ing their necks towards you.  
[Page 233, Line 71] 37. From the right, and from the left, banding 
[Page 233, Line 72] together?  
[Page 233, Line 73] 38. Is every one of them aspiring to be admit-
[Page 233, Line 74] ted into a Garden of Bliss?  
[Page 233, Line 75] 39. No indeed! We creat ed them from what 
[Page 233, Line 76] they know.  
[Page 233, Line 77] 40. I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the 
[Page 233, Line 78] Wests, that We are Able.  
[Page 233, Line 79] 222 
[Page 234, Line 1] 71.  NOAH   (Nuh)  
[Page 234, Line 2] 41. To replace them with better than they, and 
[Page 234, Line 3] We are not to be outdone.  
[Page 234, Line 4] 42. So leave them to blunder and play, until 
[Page 234, Line 5] they meet their Day which they are prom ised.  
[Page 234, Line 6] 43. The Day when they will emerge from the 
[Page 234, Line 7] tombs in a rush, as though they were hurry-
[Page 234, Line 8] ing towards a target.  
[Page 234, Line 9] 44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu-
[Page 234, Line 10] miliation. This is the Day which they were promised.  

[Page 234, Line 12] 71. NOAH  
[Page 234, Line 13] (Nuh ) 
[Page 234, Line 14] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 234, Line 15] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 234, Line 16] 1. We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your 
[Page 234, Line 17] people before there comes upon them a pain-ful punishment.”  
[Page 234, Line 18] 2. He said, “O my people, I am to you a clear 
[Page 234, Line 19] warner.  
[Page 234, Line 20] 3. Worship Allah and reverence Him, and 
[Page 234, Line 21] obey me.  
[Page 234, Line 22] 4. And He will forgive you of  your sins, and 
[Page 234, Line 23] reprieve you until a stated term. Allah’s term 
[Page 234, Line 24] cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you 
[Page 234, Line 25] only knew.”  
[Page 234, Line 26] 5. He said, “My Lord, I have called my people 
[Page 234, Line 27] night and day.  
[Page 234, Line 28] 6. But my call added only to their flight.  
[Page 234, Line 29] 7. Whenever I called them to Y our for-
[Page 234, Line 30] giveness, they thrust their fingers into their 
[Page 234, Line 31] ears, and wrapped themselves in their gar-ments, and insisted, and became more and 
[Page 234, Line 32] more arrogant.  
[Page 234, Line 33] 8. Then I called them openly.  
[Page 234, Line 34] 9. Then I appealed to them publicly, and I 
[Page 234, Line 35] spoke to them privately.  
[Page 234, Line 36] 10. I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is 
[Page 234, Line 37] Forgiving.  
[Page 234, Line 38] 11. He will let loose the sky upon you in tor-
[Page 234, Line 39] rents.  12. And provide you with wealth and children, 
[Page 234, Line 40] and allot for you gardens, and allot for you 
[Page 234, Line 41] rivers.  
[Page 234, Line 42] 13. What is the matter with you, that you do 
[Page 234, Line 43] not a ppreciate Allah’s Greatness?  
[Page 234, Line 44] 14. Although He created you in stages.  
[Page 234, Line 45] 15. Do you not realize that Allah created seven 
[Page 234, Line 46] heavens in layers?  
[Page 234, Line 47] 16. And He set the moon in their midst for 
[Page 234, Line 48] light, and He made the sun a lamp.  
[Page 234, Line 49] 17. And Allah germinated you from the earth  
[Page 234, Line 50] like plants.  
[Page 234, Line 51] 18. Then He will return you into it, and will 
[Page 234, Line 52] bring you out again.  
[Page 234, Line 53] 19. And Allah made the earth a spread for you.  
[Page 234, Line 54] 20. That you may travel its diverse roads.’”  
[Page 234, Line 55] 21. Noah said, “My Lord, they have defied me, 
[Page 234, Line 56] and followed him whose wealth and chi ldren 
[Page 234, Line 57] increase him only in perdition.” 
[Page 234, Line 58] 22. And they schemed outrageous schemes.  
[Page 234, Line 59] 23. And they said, “Do not give up your gods; 
[Page 234, Line 60] do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor 
[Page 234, Line 61] Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.  
[Page 234, Line 62] 24. They have misled many, so do not increase 
[Page 234, Line 63] the wrongdoers ex cept in confusion.”  
[Page 234, Line 64] 25. Because of their wrongs, they were 
[Page 234, Line 65] drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They did not find apart from Allah any helpers.  
[Page 234, Line 66] 26. Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the 
[Page 234, Line 67] unbelievers a single dweller on earth.  
[Page 234, Line 68] 27. If You leave them, they  will mislead your 
[Page 234, Line 69] servants, and will breed only wicked unbe-lievers.  
[Page 234, Line 70] 28. My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and 
[Page 234, Line 71] anyone who enters my home in faith, and all the believing men and believing women; and 
[Page 234, Line 72] do not increase the wrongdoers except in 
[Page 234, Line 73] perdition.”  

[Page 234, Line 75] 72. THE JINN  
[Page 234, Line 76] (al-Jinn) 
[Page 234, Line 77] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 234, Line 78] 223 
[Page 235, Line 1] 73.  THE ENWRAPPED   (al-Muzzammil)  
[Page 235, Line 2] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 235, Line 3] 1. Say, “It was revealed to me that a band of 
[Page 235, Line 4] jinn listened in, and said, ‘We have heard a 
[Page 235, Line 5] wondrous Quran.  
[Page 235, Line 6] 2. It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in 
[Page 235, Line 7] it; and we will never associate anyone with 
[Page 235, Line 8] our Lord.  
[Page 235, Line 9] 3. And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord —
[Page 235, Line 10] He never had a mate, nor a child.  
[Page 235, Line 11] 4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense 
[Page 235, Line 12] about Allah.  
[Page 235, Line 13] 5. And we thought that humans and jinn 
[Page 235, Line 14] would never utter lies about Allah.  
[Page 235, Line 15] 6. Some indi vidual humans used to seek 
[Page 235, Line 16] power through some individual jinn, but they 
[Page 235, Line 17] only increased them in confusion.  
[Page 235, Line 18] 7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah 
[Page 235, Line 19] would never resurrect anyone.  
[Page 235, Line 20] 8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled 
[Page 235, Line 21] with stern guards and projectil es. 
[Page 235, Line 22] 9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but 
[Page 235, Line 23] whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait 
[Page 235, Line 24] for him.  
[Page 235, Line 25] 10. We do not know whether ill is intended for 
[Page 235, Line 26] those on earth, or if their Lord intends good-
[Page 235, Line 27] ness for them.  
[Page 235, Line 28] 11. Some of us are righteous, but some of us are 
[Page 235, Line 29] less than that; we follow divergent paths.  
[Page 235, Line 30] 12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on 
[Page 235, Line 31] earth, and that we cannot escape Him by flee-
[Page 235, Line 32] ing. 
[Page 235, Line 33] 13. And when we heard the guidance, we be-
[Page 235, Line 34] lieved in it. Whoever believes in his Lord 
[Page 235, Line 35] fears neither loss, nor  burden.  
[Page 235, Line 36] 14. Among us are those who are submitting, 
[Page 235, Line 37] and among us are the compromisers. As for 
[Page 235, Line 38] those who have submitted —it is they who 
[Page 235, Line 39] pursue rectitude.  
[Page 235, Line 40] 15. But as for the compromisers —they will be 
[Page 235, Line 41] firewood for Hell.’”  
[Page 235, Line 42] 16. Had they kept true to the Path, We  would 
[Page 235, Line 43] have given them plenty water to drink.  17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away 
[Page 235, Line 44] from the remembrance of his Lord, He will 
[Page 235, Line 45] direct him to torment ever mounting.  
[Page 235, Line 46] 18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do 
[Page 235, Line 47] not call, besides Allah, upon anyone el se. 
[Page 235, Line 48] 19. And when the servant of Allah got up call-
[Page 235, Line 49] ing on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.  
[Page 235, Line 50] 20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never 
[Page 235, Line 51] associate anyone with Him.”  
[Page 235, Line 52] 21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor 
[Page 235, Line 53] to bring you to right conduct.”  
[Page 235, Line 54] 22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah, 
[Page 235, Line 55] and I will not find any refuge except with 
[Page 235, Line 56] Him.  
[Page 235, Line 57] 23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and 
[Page 235, Line 58] His messages. He who defies Allah and His Messenger —for him is the Fire of Hell, in 
[Page 235, Line 59] which they will dwell forever.”  
[Page 235, Line 60] 24. Until, when they see what they were prom-
[Page 235, Line 61] ised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, 
[Page 235, Line 62] and fewer in numbers.  
[Page 235, Line 63] 25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are 
[Page 235, Line 64] promised is near, or whether my Lord will ex-tend it for a period.”  
[Page 235, Line 65] 26. The Knower of the Invisible; He do es not 
[Page 235, Line 66] disclose His Invisible to anyone.  
[Page 235, Line 67] 27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He 
[Page 235, Line 68] then dispatches guards before him and be-
[Page 235, Line 69] hind him.  
[Page 235, Line 70] 28. That He may know that they have con-
[Page 235, Line 71] veyed the messages of their Lord. He encom-
[Page 235, Line 72] passes what they have, and has tallied  every-
[Page 235, Line 73] thing by number.  

[Page 235, Line 75] 73. THE ENWRAPPED  
[Page 235, Line 76] (al-Muzzammil ) 
[Page 235, Line 77] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 235, Line 78] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 235, Line 79] 1. O you Enwrapped one.  
[Page 235, Line 80] 2. Stay up during the night, except a little.  
[Page 235, Line 81] 3. For half of it, or reduce it a little.  
[Page 235, Line 82] 224 
[Page 236, Line 1] 74.  THE ENROBED   (al-Muddathir)  
[Page 236, Line 2] 4. Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmi-
[Page 236, Line 3] cally.  
[Page 236, Line 4] 5. We are about to give you a heavy message.  
[Page 236, Line 5] 6. The vigil of night is more effective, and bet-
[Page 236, Line 6] ter suited for recitation.  
[Page 236, Line 7] 7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to 
[Page 236, Line 8] do. 
[Page 236, Line 9] 8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and 
[Page 236, Line 10] devote yourself to Him wholehear tedly.  
[Page 236, Line 11] 9. Lord of the East and the West. There is no 
[Page 236, Line 12] god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.  
[Page 236, Line 13] 10. And endure patiently what they say, and 
[Page 236, Line 14] withdraw from them politely.  
[Page 236, Line 15] 11. And leave Me to those who deny the truth, 
[Page 236, Line 16] those of luxury, and give them a brief respite . 
[Page 236, Line 17] 12. With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire.  
[Page 236, Line 18] 13. And food that chokes, and a painful pun-
[Page 236, Line 19] ishment.  
[Page 236, Line 20] 14. On the Day when the earth and the moun-
[Page 236, Line 21] tains tremble, and the mountains become 
[Page 236, Line 22] heaps of sand.  
[Page 236, Line 23] 15. We have sent to you a messenger, a witness 
[Page 236, Line 24] over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.  
[Page 236, Line 25] 16. But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We 
[Page 236, Line 26] seized him with a terrible seizing.  
[Page 236, Line 27] 17. So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, 
[Page 236, Line 28] save yourself from a Day which will turn the 
[Page 236, Line 29] children gray -haired?  
[Page 236, Line 30] 18. The heaven will shatter thereby. His prom-
[Page 236, Line 31] ise is always fulfilled.  
[Page 236, Line 32] 19. This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let 
[Page 236, Line 33] him take a path to his Lord.  
[Page 236, Line 34] 20. Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly 
[Page 236, Line 35] two- thirds of the night, or half of it, or one -
[Page 236, Line 36] third of it, along with a group of those with 
[Page 236, Line 37] you. Allah designed the night and the day. He 
[Page 236, Line 38] knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what 
[Page 236, Line 39] is possible for you. He knows that some of 
[Page 236, Line 40] you may be ill; and others travelling through 
[Page 236, Line 41] the land, seeking Allah’s bounty ; and others 
[Page 236, Line 42] fighting in Allah’s cause. So read of it what is 
[Page 236, Line 43] possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend Allah a gener-
[Page 236, Line 44] ous loan. Whatever good you advance for 
[Page 236, Line 45] yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better 
[Page 236, Line 46] and generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s 
[Page 236, Line 47] forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
[Page 236, Line 48] ciful.  

[Page 236, Line 50] 74. THE ENROBED  
[Page 236, Line 51] (al-Muddathir ) 
[Page 236, Line 52] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 236, Line 53] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 236, Line 54] 1. O you Enrobed one.  
[Page 236, Line 55] 2. Arise and warn.  
[Page 236, Line 56] 3. And magnify your Lord.  
[Page 236, Line 57] 4. And purify your clothes.  
[Page 236, Line 58] 5. And abandon abominations.  
[Page 236, Line 59] 6. And show no favor seeking gain.  
[Page 236, Line 60] 7. And be constant for your Lord.  
[Page 236, Line 61] 8. When the Trumpet is blown.  
[Page 236, Line 62] 9. That Day will be a difficult day.  
[Page 236, Line 63] 10. For the disbelievers —not easy.  
[Page 236, Line 64] 11. Leave Me to him whom I created alone.  
[Page 236, Line 65] 12. And gave him  vast wealth.  
[Page 236, Line 66] 13. And children as witnesses.  
[Page 236, Line 67] 14. And smoothed things for him.  
[Page 236, Line 68] 15. Then he wants Me to add yet more!  
[Page 236, Line 69] 16. By no means! He was stubborn towards 
[Page 236, Line 70] Our revelations.  
[Page 236, Line 71] 17. I will exhaust him increasingly.  
[Page 236, Line 72] 18. He thought and analyzed.  
[Page 236, Line 73] 19. May he perish, how he analyzed.  
[Page 236, Line 74] 20. Again: may he perish, how he analyzed.  
[Page 236, Line 75] 21. Then he looked.  
[Page 236, Line 76] 22. Then he frowned and whined.  
[Page 236, Line 77] 23. Then he turned back and was proud.  
[Page 236, Line 78] 24. And said, “This is nothing but magic from 
[Page 236, Line 79] the past.  
[Page 236, Line 80] 25. This is nothing but the word of a mor tal.” 
[Page 236, Line 81] 225 
[Page 237, Line 1] 75.  RESURRECTION   (al-Qiyamah)  
[Page 237, Line 2] 26. I will roast him in Saqar.  
[Page 237, Line 3] 27. But what will explain to you what Saqar is?  
[Page 237, Line 4] 28. It neither leaves, nor spares.  
[Page 237, Line 5] 29. It scorches the flesh.  
[Page 237, Line 6] 30. Over it are Nineteen.  
[Page 237, Line 7] 31. We have appointed only angels to be war-
[Page 237, Line 8] dens of the Fire, and caused their number to 
[Page 237, Line 9] be a stumbling block for those who disbe-
[Page 237, Line 10] lieve; so that those given the Scripture may 
[Page 237, Line 11] attain certainty; and those who believe may 
[Page 237, Line 12] increase in faith; and those given the Scrip-
[Page 237, Line 13] ture and the believers may not doubt; and 
[Page 237, Line 14] those in whose hearts is sickness and the un-
[Page 237, Line 15] believers may say, “What did Allah intend by 
[Page 237, Line 16] this parable?” Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None 
[Page 237, Line 17] knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. 
[Page 237, Line 18] This is nothing but a reminder for the mor-
[Page 237, Line 19] tals. 
[Page 237, Line 20] 32. Nay! By the moon.  
[Page 237, Line 21] 33. And the night as it retreats.  
[Page 237, Line 22] 34. And the morning as it lights up.  
[Page 237, Line 23] 35. It is one of the greatest.  
[Page 237, Line 24] 36. A warning to the mortals.  
[Page 237, Line 25] 37. To whomever among you wishes to ad-
[Page 237, Line 26] vance, or regress.  
[Page 237, Line 27] 38. Every soul is hostage to what it has earned.  
[Page 237, Line 28] 39. Except for those on  the Right.  
[Page 237, Line 29] 40. In Gardens, inquiring.  
[Page 237, Line 30] 41. About the guilty.  
[Page 237, Line 31] 42. “What drove you into Saqar?”  
[Page 237, Line 32] 43. They will say, “We were not of those who 
[Page 237, Line 33] prayed.  
[Page 237, Line 34] 44. Nor did we feed the destitute.  
[Page 237, Line 35] 45. And we used to indulge with those who in-
[Page 237, Line 36] dulge.  
[Page 237, Line 37] 46. And we used to deny  the Day of Judgment.  
[Page 237, Line 38] 47. Until the Inevitable came upon us.”  
[Page 237, Line 39] 48. But the intercession of intercessors will not 
[Page 237, Line 40] help them.  49. Why are they turning away from the Re-
[Page 237, Line 41] minder?  
[Page 237, Line 42] 50. As though they were panicked donkeys.  
[Page 237, Line 43] 51. Fleeing from a lion?  
[Page 237, Line 44] 52. Yet every on e of them desires to be given 
[Page 237, Line 45] scrolls unrolled.  
[Page 237, Line 46] 53. No indeed! But they do not fear the Here-
[Page 237, Line 47] after.  
[Page 237, Line 48] 54. Nevertheless, it is a reminder.  
[Page 237, Line 49] 55. So whoever wills, shall remember it.  
[Page 237, Line 50] 56. But they will not remember, unless Allah 
[Page 237, Line 51] wills. He is the Source of Righteou sness, and 
[Page 237, Line 52] the Source of Forgiveness.  

[Page 237, Line 54] 75. RESURRECTION  
[Page 237, Line 55] (al-Qiyamah ) 
[Page 237, Line 56] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 237, Line 57] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 237, Line 58] 1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection.  
[Page 237, Line 59] 2. And I swear by the blaming soul.  
[Page 237, Line 60] 3. Does man think that We will not reassem-
[Page 237, Line 61] ble his bones?  
[Page 237, Line 62] 4. Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his 
[Page 237, Line 63] fingertips.  
[Page 237, Line 64] 5. But man wants to deny what is ahead of 
[Page 237, Line 65] him.  
[Page 237, Line 66] 6. He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrec-
[Page 237, Line 67] tion?”  
[Page 237, Line 68] 7. When vision is dazzled.  
[Page 237, Line 69] 8. And the moon is eclipsed.  
[Page 237, Line 70] 9. And the sun and the moon are joined to-
[Page 237, Line 71] gether.  
[Page 237, Line 72] 10. On that Day, man will say, “Where is the 
[Page 237, Line 73] escape?”  
[Page 237, Line 74] 11. No indeed! There is no refuge.  
[Page 237, Line 75] 12. To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.  
[Page 237, Line 76] 13. On that Day man will be informed of eve-
[Page 237, Line 77] rything he put forward, and everything he left behind.  
[Page 237, Line 78] 14. And man will be evidence against himself.  
[Page 237, Line 79] 226 
[Page 238, Line 1] 76.  MAN   (al-Insan)  
[Page 238, Line 2] 15. Even as he presents his excuses.  
[Page 238, Line 3] 16. Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry 
[Page 238, Line 4] on with it.  
[Page 238, Line 5] 17. Upon Us is its collection and its recitation.  
[Page 238, Line 6] 18. Then, when We have recited it, follow its 
[Page 238, Line 7] recitation.  
[Page 238, Line 8] 19. Then upon Us is its expl anation.  
[Page 238, Line 9] 20. Alas, you love the fleeting life.  
[Page 238, Line 10] 21. And you disregard the Hereafter.  
[Page 238, Line 11] 22. Faces on that Day will be radiant.  
[Page 238, Line 12] 23. Looking towards their Lord.  
[Page 238, Line 13] 24. And faces on that Day will be gloomy.  
[Page 238, Line 14] 25. Realizing that a back -breaker has befallen 
[Page 238, Line 15] them.  
[Page 238, Line 16] 26. Indeed, when it has reached the breast -
[Page 238, Line 17] bones.  
[Page 238, Line 18] 27. And it is said, “Who is the healer?”  
[Page 238, Line 19] 28. And He realizes that it is the parting.  
[Page 238, Line 20] 29. And leg is entwined with leg.  
[Page 238, Line 21] 30. To your Lord on that Day is the drive.  
[Page 238, Line 22] 31. He neither believed nor prayed.  
[Page 238, Line 23] 32. But he denied and turned away.  
[Page 238, Line 24] 33. Then he went to his family, full of pride.  
[Page 238, Line 25] 34. Woe to you; and woe.  
[Page 238, Line 26] 35. Then again: Woe to you; and woe.  
[Page 238, Line 27] 36. Does man think that he will be left without 
[Page 238, Line 28] purpose?  
[Page 238, Line 29] 37. Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?  
[Page 238, Line 30] 38. Then he became a cl ot. And He created and 
[Page 238, Line 31] proportioned?  
[Page 238, Line 32] 39. And made of him the two sexes, the male 
[Page 238, Line 33] and the female?  
[Page 238, Line 34] 40. Is He not Able to revive the dead?  

[Page 238, Line 36] 76. MAN  
[Page 238, Line 37] (al-Insan)  
[Page 238, Line 38] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 238, Line 39] the Gracious, the Merciful  1. Has there come upon man a period of time 
[Page 238, Line 40] when he was nothing to be mentioned?  
[Page 238, Line 41] 2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to 
[Page 238, Line 42] test him; and We made him hearing and see-
[Page 238, Line 43] ing. 
[Page 238, Line 44] 3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia-
[Page 238, Line 45] tive or unappreciative.  
[Page 238, Line 46] 4. We have prepared for the faithless chains, 
[Page 238, Line 47] and yokes, and a Sear ing Fire.  
[Page 238, Line 48] 5. But the righteous will drink from a cup 
[Page 238, Line 49] whose mixture is aroma.  
[Page 238, Line 50] 6. A spring from which the servants of Allah 
[Page 238, Line 51] will drink, making it gush abundantly.  
[Page 238, Line 52] 7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day 
[Page 238, Line 53] whose ill is widespread.  
[Page 238, Line 54] 8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, 
[Page 238, Line 55] and the orphan, and the captive.  
[Page 238, Line 56] 9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We 
[Page 238, Line 57] want from you neither compensation, nor 
[Page 238, Line 58] gratitude.  
[Page 238, Line 59] 10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim 
[Page 238, Line 60] Day.”  
[Page 238, Line 61] 11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of 
[Page 238, Line 62] that Day, and will grant them radiance and 
[Page 238, Line 63] joy. 
[Page 238, Line 64] 12. And will reward them for their patience 
[Page 238, Line 65] with a Garden and silk.  
[Page 238, Line 66] 13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi-
[Page 238, Line 67] encing therein neither sun, nor frost.  
[Page 238, Line 68] 14. Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit 
[Page 238, Line 69] brought low wi thin reach.  
[Page 238, Line 70] 15. Passing around them are vessels of silver, 
[Page 238, Line 71] and cups of crystal.  
[Page 238, Line 72] 16. Crystal of silver —they measured them ex-
[Page 238, Line 73] actly.  
[Page 238, Line 74] 17. They will be served therein with a cup 
[Page 238, Line 75] whose flavor is Zanjabeel.  
[Page 238, Line 76] 18. A spring therein named Salsabeel.  
[Page 238, Line 77] 19. Passing among  them are eternalized 
[Page 238, Line 78] youths. If you see them, you would think 
[Page 238, Line 79] them sprinkled pearls.  
[Page 238, Line 80] 227 
[Page 239, Line 1] 77.  THE UNLEASHED   (al-Mursalat)  
[Page 239, Line 2] 20. Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a 
[Page 239, Line 3] vast kingdom.  
[Page 239, Line 4] 21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and 
[Page 239, Line 5] satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets 
[Page 239, Line 6] of silver. And thei r Lord will offer them a 
[Page 239, Line 7] pure drink.  
[Page 239, Line 8] 22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are 
[Page 239, Line 9] well appreciated.”  
[Page 239, Line 10] 23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon 
[Page 239, Line 11] you—a gradual revelation.  
[Page 239, Line 12] 24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord, 
[Page 239, Line 13] and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer among them.  
[Page 239, Line 14] 25. And mention the Name of your Lord, 
[Page 239, Line 15] morning and evening.  
[Page 239, Line 16] 26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself 
[Page 239, Line 17] to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.  
[Page 239, Line 18] 27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and 
[Page 239, Line 19] leave behind a Heavy Day.  
[Page 239, Line 20] 28. We created them, and strengthened their 
[Page 239, Line 21] frame; and whenever We will, We can replace 
[Page 239, Line 22] them with others like them.  
[Page 239, Line 23] 29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let 
[Page 239, Line 24] him take a path to his Lord.  
[Page 239, Line 25] 30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al-
[Page 239, Line 26] lah is Knowing and Wise.  
[Page 239, Line 27] 31. He admits into His mercy whomever He 
[Page 239, Line 28] wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre-
[Page 239, Line 29] pared for them a painful punishment.  

[Page 239, Line 31] 77. THE UNLEASHED  
[Page 239, Line 32] (al-Mursalat ) 
[Page 239, Line 33] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 239, Line 34] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 239, Line 35] 1. By those unleashed in succession.  
[Page 239, Line 36] 2. Storm ing turbulently.  
[Page 239, Line 37] 3. Scattering far and wide.  
[Page 239, Line 38] 4. Separating decisively.  
[Page 239, Line 39] 5. Delivering a message.  
[Page 239, Line 40] 6. Excusing or warning.  
[Page 239, Line 41] 7. Surely what you are promised will happen.  8. When the stars are obliterated.  
[Page 239, Line 42] 9. And the sky is fractured.  
[Page 239, Line 43] 10. And the mountains are b lown away.  
[Page 239, Line 44] 11. And the messengers are alerted.  
[Page 239, Line 45] 12. Until which day is it deferred?  
[Page 239, Line 46] 13. Until the Day of Decision.  
[Page 239, Line 47] 14. And what will teach you what the Day of 
[Page 239, Line 48] Decision is?  
[Page 239, Line 49] 15. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
[Page 239, Line 50] 16. Did We not destroy the ancients?  
[Page 239, Line 51] 17. Then succeeded them with the others?  
[Page 239, Line 52] 18. This is how We deal with the guilty.  
[Page 239, Line 53] 19. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
[Page 239, Line 54] 20. Did We not create you from an insignifi-
[Page 239, Line 55] cant fluid?  
[Page 239, Line 56] 21. Then lodged it in a secure place?  
[Page 239, Line 57] 22. For a known term?  
[Page 239, Line 58] 23. We measured precisely. We are the best to 
[Page 239, Line 59] measure.  
[Page 239, Line 60] 24. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.  
[Page 239, Line 61] 25. Did We not make the earth a homestead?  
[Page 239, Line 62] 26. For the living and the dead?  
[Page 239, Line 63] 27. And set on it lofty mountains, and given 
[Page 239, Line 64] you pure water to drink?  
[Page 239, Line 65] 28. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
[Page 239, Line 66] 29. “Proce ed to what you used to deny.”  
[Page 239, Line 67] 30. “Proceed to a shadow of three different 
[Page 239, Line 68] masses.”  
[Page 239, Line 69] 31. Offering no shade, and unavailing against 
[Page 239, Line 70] the flames.  
[Page 239, Line 71] 32. It shoots sparks as castles.  
[Page 239, Line 72] 33. As if they were yellow camels.  
[Page 239, Line 73] 34. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
[Page 239, Line 74] 35. This is a Day when they will not speak.  
[Page 239, Line 75] 36. And they will not be allowed to apologize.  
[Page 239, Line 76] 37. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
[Page 239, Line 77] 38. This is the Day of Separation; We have 
[Page 239, Line 78] gathered you, together with the ancients.  
[Page 239, Line 79] 228 
[Page 240, Line 1] 78.  THE EVENT   (an-Naba’)  
[Page 240, Line 2] 39. So if you have a strategy, use it against Me.  
[Page 240, Line 3] 40. Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.  
[Page 240, Line 4] 41. The righteous will be amidst shades and 
[Page 240, Line 5] fountains.  
[Page 240, Line 6] 42. And fruits as they desire.  
[Page 240, Line 7] 43. “Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you 
[Page 240, Line 8] used to do.”  
[Page 240, Line 9] 44. This is how We reward the doers of good.  
[Page 240, Line 10] 45. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
[Page 240, Line 11] 46. “Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are 
[Page 240, Line 12] indeed criminals.”  
[Page 240, Line 13] 47. Woe on that Day to the liars.  
[Page 240, Line 14] 48. And when it is said to them, “Kneel”, they 
[Page 240, Line 15] do not kneel.  
[Page 240, Line 16] 49. Woe on that Day to the rejecters.  
[Page 240, Line 17] 50. In what message, beyond this, will they be-
[Page 240, Line 18] lieve?  

[Page 240, Line 20] 78. THE EVENT  
[Page 240, Line 21] (an-Naba’ ) 
[Page 240, Line 22] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 240, Line 23] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 240, Line 24] 1. What are they asking one another about?  
[Page 240, Line 25] 2. About the Great Event.  
[Page 240, Line 26] 3. About which they disagree.  
[Page 240, Line 27] 4. Surely, they will find out.  
[Page 240, Line 28] 5. Most certainly, they will find out.  
[Page 240, Line 29] 6. Did We not make the earth a cradle?  
[Page 240, Line 30] 7. And the mountains pegs?  
[Page 240, Line 31] 8. And created you in pairs?  
[Page 240, Line 32] 9. And made your sleep for rest?  
[Page 240, Line 33] 10. And made the night a cover?  
[Page 240, Line 34] 11. And made the day for livelihood?  
[Page 240, Line 35] 12. And built above you seven strong ones?  
[Page 240, Line 36] 13. And placed a blazing lamp?  
[Page 240, Line 37] 14. And brought down from the clouds pour-
[Page 240, Line 38] ing water?  
[Page 240, Line 39] 15. To produce with it grains and vegetation?  16. And luxuriant gardens?  
[Page 240, Line 40] 17. The Day of Sorting has been appointed.  
[Page 240, Line 41] 18. The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and 
[Page 240, Line 42] you will come in droves.  
[Page 240, Line 43] 19. And the sky is opened up, and becomes 
[Page 240, Line 44] gateways.  
[Page 240, Line 45] 20. And the mountains are set in motion, and 
[Page 240, Line 46] become a mirage.  
[Page 240, Line 47] 21. Hell is lying in ambush.  
[Page 240, Line 48] 22. For the oppressors, a destination.  
[Page 240, Line 49] 23. Where they will remain for eons.  
[Page 240, Line 50] 24. They will taste therein neither coolnes s, 
[Page 240, Line 51] nor drink.  
[Page 240, Line 52] 25. Except boiling water, and freezing hail.  
[Page 240, Line 53] 26. A fitting requital.  
[Page 240, Line 54] 27. For they were not anticipating any reckon-
[Page 240, Line 55] ing. 
[Page 240, Line 56] 28. And they denied Our signs utterly.  
[Page 240, Line 57] 29. But We have enumerated everything in 
[Page 240, Line 58] writing.  
[Page 240, Line 59] 30. So taste! We will increase you  only in suf-
[Page 240, Line 60] fering.  
[Page 240, Line 61] 31. But for the righteous there is triumph.  
[Page 240, Line 62] 32. Gardens and vineyards.  
[Page 240, Line 63] 33. And splendid spouses, well matched.  
[Page 240, Line 64] 34. And delicious drinks.  
[Page 240, Line 65] 35. They will hear therein neither gossip, nor 
[Page 240, Line 66] lies. 
[Page 240, Line 67] 36. A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift.  
[Page 240, Line 68] 37. Lord of the heavens and the earth, and eve-
[Page 240, Line 69] rything between them —The Most Merci-
[Page 240, Line 70] ful—none can argue with Him.  
[Page 240, Line 71] 38. On the Day when the Spirit and the angels 
[Page 240, Line 72] stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be 
[Page 240, Line 73] one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he 
[Page 240, Line 74] will say w hat is right.  
[Page 240, Line 75] 39. That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, 
[Page 240, Line 76] let him take a way back to his Lord.  
[Page 240, Line 77] 40.  We have warned you of a near punish-
[Page 240, Line 78] ment —the Day when a person will observe 
[Page 240, Line 79] 229 
[Page 241, Line 1] 79.  THE SNATCHERS   (an-Nazi’at)  
[Page 241, Line 2] what his hands have produced, and the faith-
[Page 241, Line 3] less will say, “O, I wish I were  dust.”  

[Page 241, Line 5] 79. THE SNATCHERS  
[Page 241, Line 6] (an-Nazi’at ) 
[Page 241, Line 7] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 241, Line 8] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 241, Line 9] 1. By those who snatch violently.  
[Page 241, Line 10] 2. And those who remove gently.  
[Page 241, Line 11] 3. And those who glide smoothly.  
[Page 241, Line 12] 4. And those who race swiftly.  
[Page 241, Line 13] 5. And those who regulate events.  
[Page 241, Line 14] 6. On the Day when the Quake quakes.  
[Page 241, Line 15] 7. And is followed by the Successor.  
[Page 241, Line 16] 8. Hearts on that Day will be pounding.  
[Page 241, Line 17] 9. Their sights downcast.  
[Page 241, Line 18] 10. They say, “Are we to be restored to the 
[Page 241, Line 19] original condition?  
[Page 241, Line 20] 11. When we have become hollow bones?”  
[Page 241, Line 21] 12. They say,  “This is a losing proposition.”  
[Page 241, Line 22] 13. But it will be only a single nudge.  
[Page 241, Line 23] 14. And they will be awake.  
[Page 241, Line 24] 15. Has the story of Moses reached you?  
[Page 241, Line 25] 16. When His Lord called out to him in the sa-
[Page 241, Line 26] cred valley of Tuwa.  
[Page 241, Line 27] 17. “Go to Pharaoh— he has transgressed.”  
[Page 241, Line 28] 18. And  say, “Do you care to be cleansed?  
[Page 241, Line 29] 19. And I will guide you to your Lord, and you 
[Page 241, Line 30] will turn reverent.”  
[Page 241, Line 31] 20. He showed him the Greatest Miracle.  
[Page 241, Line 32] 21. But he denied and defied.  
[Page 241, Line 33] 22. Then turned his back, and tried.  
[Page 241, Line 34] 23. And gathered and proclaimed.  
[Page 241, Line 35] 24. He said, “I am your Lord, the most high.”  
[Page 241, Line 36] 25. So Allah seized him with an exemplary 
[Page 241, Line 37] punishment, in the last and in the first.  
[Page 241, Line 38] 26. In this is a lesson for whoever fears.  27. Are you more difficult to create, or the 
[Page 241, Line 39] heaven? He constructed it.  
[Page 241, Line 40] 28. He raised its masses , and proportioned it.  
[Page 241, Line 41] 29. And He dimmed its night, and brought out 
[Page 241, Line 42] its daylight.  
[Page 241, Line 43] 30. And the earth after that He spread.  
[Page 241, Line 44] 31. And from it, He produced its water and its 
[Page 241, Line 45] pasture.  
[Page 241, Line 46] 32. And the mountains, He anchored.  
[Page 241, Line 47] 33. A source of enjoyment for you and for your 
[Page 241, Line 48] animals.  
[Page 241, Line 49] 34. But when the Great Cataclysm arrives.  
[Page 241, Line 50] 35. A Day when man will remember what he 
[Page 241, Line 51] has endeavored.  
[Page 241, Line 52] 36. And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees.  
[Page 241, Line 53] 37. As for him who was defiant.  
[Page 241, Line 54] 38. And preferred the life of this world.  
[Page 241, Line 55] 39. Then Hell is the shelter.  
[Page 241, Line 56] 40. But as for him who feared the Standing of 
[Page 241, Line 57] his Lord, and restrained the self from desires.  
[Page 241, Line 58] 41. Then Paradise is the shelter.  
[Page 241, Line 59] 42. They ask you about the Hour, “When will 
[Page 241, Line 60] it take place?”  
[Page 241, Line 61] 43. You have no knowledge of it.  
[Page 241, Line 62] 44. To your Lord is its fi nality.  
[Page 241, Line 63] 45. You are just a warner for whoever dreads 
[Page 241, Line 64] it. 
[Page 241, Line 65] 46. On the Day when they witness it —as 
[Page 241, Line 66] though they only stayed an evening, or its morning.  

[Page 241, Line 68] 80. HE FROWNED  
[Page 241, Line 69] (‘Abasa ) 
[Page 241, Line 70] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 241, Line 71] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 241, Line 72] 1. He frowned and turned away.  
[Page 241, Line 73] 2. When the blind man approached him.  
[Page 241, Line 74] 3. But how do you know? Perhaps he was 
[Page 241, Line 75] seeking to purify himself.  
[Page 241, Line 76] 230 
[Page 242, Line 1] 81.  THE ROLLING   (at-Takwir)  
[Page 242, Line 2] 4. Or be reminded, and the message would 
[Page 242, Line 3] benefit him.  
[Page 242, Line 4] 5. But as for him who was indifferent.  
[Page 242, Line 5] 6. You gave him your attention.  
[Page 242, Line 6] 7. Though you are not liabl e if he does not pu-
[Page 242, Line 7] rify himself.  
[Page 242, Line 8] 8. But as for him who came to you seeking.  
[Page 242, Line 9] 9. In awe.  
[Page 242, Line 10] 10. To him you were inattentive.  
[Page 242, Line 11] 11. Do not. This is a Lesson.  
[Page 242, Line 12] 12. Whoever wills, shall remember it.  
[Page 242, Line 13] 13. On honorable pages.  
[Page 242, Line 14] 14. Exalted and purified.  
[Page 242, Line 15] 15. By the hands o f scribes.  
[Page 242, Line 16] 16. Noble and devoted.  
[Page 242, Line 17] 17. Perish man! How thankless he is!  
[Page 242, Line 18] 18. From what did He create him?  
[Page 242, Line 19] 19. From a sperm drop He created him, and 
[Page 242, Line 20] enabled him.  
[Page 242, Line 21] 20. Then He eased the way for him.  
[Page 242, Line 22] 21. Then He puts him to death, and buries 
[Page 242, Line 23] him.  
[Page 242, Line 24] 22. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect 
[Page 242, Line 25] him.  
[Page 242, Line 26] 23. But no, he did not fulfill what He has com-
[Page 242, Line 27] manded him.  
[Page 242, Line 28] 24. Let man consider his food.  
[Page 242, Line 29] 25. We pour down water in abundance.  
[Page 242, Line 30] 26. Then crack the soil open.  
[Page 242, Line 31] 27. And grow in it grains.  
[Page 242, Line 32] 28. And grapes and herbs.  
[Page 242, Line 33] 29. And olives and dates.  
[Page 242, Line 34] 30. And luscious gardens.  
[Page 242, Line 35] 31. And fruits and vegetables.  
[Page 242, Line 36] 32. Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock.  
[Page 242, Line 37] 33. But when the Deafening Noise comes to 
[Page 242, Line 38] pass.  34. The Day when a person will flee from his 
[Page 242, Line 39] brother.  
[Page 242, Line 40] 35. And his mother and his fathe r. 
[Page 242, Line 41] 36. And his consort and his children.  
[Page 242, Line 42] 37. Every one of them, on that Day, will have 
[Page 242, Line 43] enough to preoccupy him.  
[Page 242, Line 44] 38. Faces on that Day will be radiant.  
[Page 242, Line 45] 39. Laughing and rejoicing.  
[Page 242, Line 46] 40. And Faces on that Day will be covered with 
[Page 242, Line 47] misery.  
[Page 242, Line 48] 41. Overwhelmed by rem orse.  
[Page 242, Line 49] 42. These are the faithless, the vicious.  

[Page 242, Line 51] 81. THE ROLLING  
[Page 242, Line 52] (at-Takwir ) 
[Page 242, Line 53] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 242, Line 54] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 242, Line 55] 1. When the sun is rolled up.  
[Page 242, Line 56] 2. When the stars are dimmed.  
[Page 242, Line 57] 3. When the mountains are set in motion.  
[Page 242, Line 58] 4. When the relationships ar e suspended.  
[Page 242, Line 59] 5. When the beasts are gathered.  
[Page 242, Line 60] 6. When the oceans are set aflame.  
[Page 242, Line 61] 7. When the souls are paired.  
[Page 242, Line 62] 8. When the girl, buried alive, is asked:  
[Page 242, Line 63] 9. For what crime was she killed?  
[Page 242, Line 64] 10. When the records are made public.  
[Page 242, Line 65] 11. When the sky is peeled away.  
[Page 242, Line 66] 12. When the Fire is set ablaze.  
[Page 242, Line 67] 13. When Paradise is brought near.  
[Page 242, Line 68] 14. Each soul will know what it has readied.  
[Page 242, Line 69] 15. I swear by the galaxies.  
[Page 242, Line 70] 16. Precisely running their courses.  
[Page 242, Line 71] 17. And by the night as it recedes.  
[Page 242, Line 72] 18. And by the morn as it breathes.  
[Page 242, Line 73] 19. This is the speech of a noble messenger.  
[Page 242, Line 74] 231 
[Page 243, Line 1] 82.  THE SHATTERING  (al -Infitar)  
[Page 243, Line 2] 20. Endowed with power, eminent with the 
[Page 243, Line 3] Lord of the Throne.  
[Page 243, Line 4] 21. Obeyed and honest.  
[Page 243, Line 5] 22. Your friend is not possessed.  
[Page 243, Line 6] 23. He saw him on the luminous horizon.  
[Page 243, Line 7] 24. And He does not withhold knowledge of 
[Page 243, Line 8] the Unsee n. 
[Page 243, Line 9] 25. And it is not the word of an accursed devil.  
[Page 243, Line 10] 26. So where are you heading?  
[Page 243, Line 11] 27. It is only a Reminder to all mankind.  
[Page 243, Line 12] 28. To whoever of you wills to go straight.  
[Page 243, Line 13] 29. But you cannot will, unless Allah wills —
[Page 243, Line 14] The Lord of the Worlds.  

[Page 243, Line 16] 82. THE SHATTERING  
[Page 243, Line 17] (al-Infitar ) 
[Page 243, Line 18] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 243, Line 19] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 243, Line 20] 1. When the sky breaks apart.  
[Page 243, Line 21] 2. When the planets are scattered.  
[Page 243, Line 22] 3. When the oceans are exploded.  
[Page 243, Line 23] 4. When the tombs are strewn around.  
[Page 243, Line 24] 5. Each soul will know what it has advanced, 
[Page 243, Line 25] and what it has deferred.  
[Page 243, Line 26] 6. O man! What deluded you concerning your 
[Page 243, Line 27] Lord, the Most Generous?  
[Page 243, Line 28] 7. He Who created you, and formed you, and 
[Page 243, Line 29] proportioned you?  
[Page 243, Line 30] 8. In whatever shape He willed, He assembled 
[Page 243, Line 31] you.  
[Page 243, Line 32] 9. But you reject the religion.  
[Page 243, Line 33] 10. Though over you are watcher s. 
[Page 243, Line 34] 11. Honest recorders.  
[Page 243, Line 35] 12. They know everything you do.  
[Page 243, Line 36] 13. The virtuous will be in bliss.  
[Page 243, Line 37] 14. While the wicked will be in Hell.  
[Page 243, Line 38] 15. They will enter it on the Day of Justice.  
[Page 243, Line 39] 16. And they will not be absent from it.  17. But what will convey to you what the Day 
[Page 243, Line 40] of Justice is?  
[Page 243, Line 41] 18. Then again, what will convey to you what 
[Page 243, Line 42] the Day of Justice is?  
[Page 243, Line 43] 19. The Day when no soul will avail another 
[Page 243, Line 44] soul anything; and the decision on that Day 
[Page 243, Line 45] is Allah’s.  

[Page 243, Line 47] 83. THE DEFRAUDERS  
[Page 243, Line 48] (al-Mutaffifin ) 
[Page 243, Line 49] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 243, Line 50] the Gr acious, the Merciful  
[Page 243, Line 51] 1. Woe to the defrauders.  
[Page 243, Line 52] 2. Those who, when they take a measure from 
[Page 243, Line 53] people, they take in full.  
[Page 243, Line 54] 3. But when they measure or weigh to others, 
[Page 243, Line 55] they cheat.  
[Page 243, Line 56] 4. Do these not know that they will be resur-
[Page 243, Line 57] rected?  
[Page 243, Line 58] 5. For a Great Day?  
[Page 243, Line 59] 6. The Day when mankind will stand before 
[Page 243, Line 60] the Lord of the Worlds?  
[Page 243, Line 61] 7. Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijj-
[Page 243, Line 62] een. 
[Page 243, Line 63] 8. But how can you know what Sijjeen is?  
[Page 243, Line 64] 9. A numerical book.  
[Page 243, Line 65] 10. Woe on that Day to the deniers.  
[Page 243, Line 66] 11. Those who deny the Day of Reckoning.  
[Page 243, Line 67] 12. But none denies it except the sinful aggres-
[Page 243, Line 68] sor. 
[Page 243, Line 69] 13. When Our revelations are recited to him, 
[Page 243, Line 70] he says, “Legends of the ancients.”  
[Page 243, Line 71] 14. Not at all. Their hearts have become cor-
[Page 243, Line 72] roded by what they used to earn.  
[Page 243, Line 73] 15. Not at all. On that Day, they will be 
[Page 243, Line 74] screen ed from their Lord.  
[Page 243, Line 75] 16. Then they will roast in Hell.  
[Page 243, Line 76] 17. Then it will be said, “This is what you used 
[Page 243, Line 77] to deny.”  
[Page 243, Line 78] 232 
[Page 244, Line 1] 84.  THE RUPTURE   (al-Inshiqa q) 
[Page 244, Line 2] 18. No indeed; the record of the righteous is in 
[Page 244, Line 3] Elliyyeen.  
[Page 244, Line 4] 19. But how can you know what Elliyyoon is?  
[Page 244, Line 5] 20. A numerical book.  
[Page 244, Line 6] 21. Witnessed by those brought near.  
[Page 244, Line 7] 22. Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss.  
[Page 244, Line 8] 23. On thrones, looking on.  
[Page 244, Line 9] 24. You will recognize on their faces the radi-
[Page 244, Line 10] ance of bliss.  
[Page 244, Line 11] 25. They will be given to drink a sealed wine.  
[Page 244, Line 12] 26. Whose seal is musk —this is what compet-
[Page 244, Line 13] itors should  compete for.  
[Page 244, Line 14] 27. Its mixture is of Tasneem.  
[Page 244, Line 15] 28. A spring from which those brought near 
[Page 244, Line 16] drink.  
[Page 244, Line 17] 29. Those who committed crimes used to 
[Page 244, Line 18] laugh at those who believed.  
[Page 244, Line 19] 30. And when they passed by them, they would 
[Page 244, Line 20] wink at one another.  
[Page 244, Line 21] 31. And when they went back  to their families, 
[Page 244, Line 22] they would go back exulting.  
[Page 244, Line 23] 32. And if they saw them, they would say, 
[Page 244, Line 24] “These people are lost.”  
[Page 244, Line 25] 33. Yet they were not sent as guardians over 
[Page 244, Line 26] them.  
[Page 244, Line 27] 34. But on that Day, those who believed will 
[Page 244, Line 28] laugh at the unbelievers.  
[Page 244, Line 29] 35. On luxurious furnishings, looking on.  
[Page 244, Line 30] 36. Have the unbelievers been repaid for what 
[Page 244, Line 31] they used to do?  

[Page 244, Line 33] 84. THE RUPTURE  
[Page 244, Line 34] (al-Inshiqaq ) 
[Page 244, Line 35] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 244, Line 36] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 244, Line 37] 1. When the sky is ruptured.  
[Page 244, Line 38] 2. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.  
[Page 244, Line 39] 3. And when the e arth is leveled out.  4. And casts out what is in it, and becomes 
[Page 244, Line 40] empty.  
[Page 244, Line 41] 5. And hearkens to its Lord, as it must.  
[Page 244, Line 42] 6. O man! You are laboring towards your 
[Page 244, Line 43] Lord, and you will meet Him.  
[Page 244, Line 44] 7. As for him who is given his book in his right 
[Page 244, Line 45] hand.  
[Page 244, Line 46] 8. He will have an easy settlement.  
[Page 244, Line 47] 9. And will return to his family delighted.  
[Page 244, Line 48] 10. But as for him who is given his book behind 
[Page 244, Line 49] his back.  
[Page 244, Line 50] 11. He will call for death.  
[Page 244, Line 51] 12. And will enter the Blaze.  
[Page 244, Line 52] 13. He used to be happy among his family.  
[Page 244, Line 53] 14. He thought he would never return.  
[Page 244, Line 54] 15. In fact, his Lord was watching him.  
[Page 244, Line 55] 16. I swear by the twilight.  
[Page 244, Line 56] 17. And by the night, and what it covers.  
[Page 244, Line 57] 18. And by the moon, as it grows full.  
[Page 244, Line 58] 19. You will mount stage by stage.  
[Page 244, Line 59] 20. What is the matter with them that they do 
[Page 244, Line 60] not believe?  
[Page 244, Line 61] 21. And when the Quran is read to them, they 
[Page 244, Line 62] do not bow down?  
[Page 244, Line 63] 22. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.  
[Page 244, Line 64] 23. But Allah knows what they hide inside.  
[Page 244, Line 65] 24. So inform them of a painful punishment.  
[Page 244, Line 66] 25. Except those who believe and do good 
[Page 244, Line 67] deeds; they will have an undiminished re-
[Page 244, Line 68] ward.  

[Page 244, Line 70] 85. THE CONSTELLATIONS  
[Page 244, Line 71] (al-Buruj ) 
[Page 244, Line 72] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 244, Line 73] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 244, Line 74] 1. By the sky with the constellations.  
[Page 244, Line 75] 2. And by the Promised Day.  
[Page 244, Line 76] 3. And by the witness and the witnessed.  
[Page 244, Line 77] 233 
[Page 245, Line 1] 86.  THE NIGHTLY VISITOR   (at-Tariq)  
[Page 245, Line 2] 4. Destroyed were the People of the Trench . 
[Page 245, Line 3] 5. The fire supplied with fuel.  
[Page 245, Line 4] 6. While they sat around it.  
[Page 245, Line 5] 7. And were witnessing what they did to the 
[Page 245, Line 6] believers.  
[Page 245, Line 7] 8. They begrudged them only because they be-
[Page 245, Line 8] lieved in Allah the Almighty, the Praisewor-
[Page 245, Line 9] thy. 
[Page 245, Line 10] 9. To Whom belongs the sovereignty of the 
[Page 245, Line 11] heav ens and the earth. Allah is witness over 
[Page 245, Line 12] everything.  
[Page 245, Line 13] 10. Those who tempt the believers, men and 
[Page 245, Line 14] women, then do not repent; for them is the 
[Page 245, Line 15] punishment of Hell; for them is the punish-
[Page 245, Line 16] ment of Burning.  
[Page 245, Line 17] 11. Those who believe and do righteous deeds 
[Page 245, Line 18] will have Gar dens beneath which rivers flow. 
[Page 245, Line 19] That is the great triumph.  
[Page 245, Line 20] 12. The onslaught of your Lord is severe.  
[Page 245, Line 21] 13. It is He who begins and repeats.  
[Page 245, Line 22] 14. And He is the Forgiving, the Loving.  
[Page 245, Line 23] 15. Possessor of the Glorious Throne.  
[Page 245, Line 24] 16. Doer of whatever He wills.  
[Page 245, Line 25] 17. Has there come to you the story of the le-
[Page 245, Line 26] gions? 
[Page 245, Line 27] 18. Of Pharaoh and Thamood?  
[Page 245, Line 28] 19. In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.  
[Page 245, Line 29] 20. And Allah encloses them from beyond.  
[Page 245, Line 30] 21. In fact, it is a Glorious Quran.  
[Page 245, Line 31] 22. In a Preserved Tablet.  

[Page 245, Line 33] 86. THE NIGHTLY VISITOR  
[Page 245, Line 34] (at-Tariq ) 
[Page 245, Line 35] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 245, Line 36] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 245, Line 37] 1. By the sky and at -Tariq.  
[Page 245, Line 38] 2. But what will let you know what at- Tariq is?  
[Page 245, Line 39] 3. The Piercing Star.  
[Page 245, Line 40] 4. There is no soul without a Protector over it.  5. Let man consider what he was created from.  
[Page 245, Line 41] 6. He was created from gushing liquid.  
[Page 245, Line 42] 7. Issuing from between the backbone and the 
[Page 245, Line 43] breastbones.  
[Page 245, Line 44] 8. He is certainly able to return him.  
[Page 245, Line 45] 9. On the Day when the secrets are disclosed.  
[Page 245, Line 46] 10. He will have no strength, and no supporter.  
[Page 245, Line 47] 11. By the sky that returns.  
[Page 245, Line 48] 12. And the earth that cracks open.  
[Page 245, Line 49] 13. It is a Decisive Word.  
[Page 245, Line 50] 14. It is no joke.  
[Page 245, Line 51] 15. They plot and scheme.  
[Page 245, Line 52] 16. But I plot and scheme.  
[Page 245, Line 53] 17. Therefore, give the blasphemers respite, a 
[Page 245, Line 54] brief respite.  

[Page 245, Line 56] 87. THE MOST HIGH  
[Page 245, Line 57] (al-A’la) 
[Page 245, Line 58] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 245, Line 59] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 245, Line 60] 1. Praise the Name of your Lord, the Most 
[Page 245, Line 61] High.  
[Page 245, Line 62] 2. He who creates and regulates.  
[Page 245, Line 63] 3. He who measures and guides.  
[Page 245, Line 64] 4. He who produces the pasture.  
[Page 245, Line 65] 5. And then turns it into light debris.  
[Page 245, Line 66] 6. We will make you read, so do not forget.  
[Page 245, Line 67] 7. Except what Allah wills. He knows what is 
[Page 245, Line 68] declared, and what is hidden.  
[Page 245, Line 69] 8. We will ease you into the Easy Way.  
[Page 245, Line 70] 9. So remind, if reminding helps.  
[Page 245, Line 71] 10. The reverent will remember.  
[Page 245, Line 72] 11. But the wretched will avoid it.  
[Page 245, Line 73] 12. He who will enter the Gigantic Fire.  
[Page 245, Line 74] 13. Where he will neither die, nor live.  
[Page 245, Line 75] 14. Successful is he who purifies himself.  
[Page 245, Line 76] 234 
[Page 246, Line 1] 88.  THE OVERWHELMING   (al-Ghashiyah)  
[Page 246, Line 2] 15. And mentions the name of his Lord, and 
[Page 246, Line 3] prays.  
[Page 246, Line 4] 16. But you prefer the present life.  
[Page 246, Line 5] 17. Though the Hereafter is better, and more 
[Page 246, Line 6] lasting.  
[Page 246, Line 7] 18. This is in the former scrip tures.  
[Page 246, Line 8] 19. The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.  

[Page 246, Line 10] 88. THE OVERWHELMING  
[Page 246, Line 11] (al-Ghashiyah ) 
[Page 246, Line 12] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 246, Line 13] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 246, Line 14] 1. Has there come to you the news of the over-
[Page 246, Line 15] whelming?  
[Page 246, Line 16] 2. Faces on that Day will be shamed.  
[Page 246, Line 17] 3. Laboring and exhausted.  
[Page 246, Line 18] 4. Roasting in a scorching Fire.  
[Page 246, Line 19] 5. Given to drink from a flaming spring.  
[Page 246, Line 20] 6. They will have no food except thorns.  
[Page 246, Line 21] 7. That neither nourishes, nor satisfies hun-
[Page 246, Line 22] ger. 
[Page 246, Line 23] 8. Faces on that Day will be joyful.  
[Page 246, Line 24] 9. Satisfied with their endeavor.  
[Page 246, Line 25] 10. In a lofty Garden.  
[Page 246, Line 26] 11. In it you will hear no nonsense.  
[Page 246, Line 27] 12. In it is a flowing spring.  
[Page 246, Line 28] 13. In it are raised beds.  
[Page 246, Line 29] 14. And cups set in place.  
[Page 246, Line 30] 15. And cushions set in rows.  
[Page 246, Line 31] 16. And carpets spread around.  
[Page 246, Line 32] 17. Do they not look at the camels —how they 
[Page 246, Line 33] are created?  
[Page 246, Line 34] 18. And at the  sky—how it is raised?  
[Page 246, Line 35] 19. And at the mountains —how they are in-
[Page 246, Line 36] stalled?  
[Page 246, Line 37] 20. And at the earth —how it is spread out?  
[Page 246, Line 38] 21. So remind. You are only a reminder.  
[Page 246, Line 39] 22. You have no control over them.  23. But whoever turns away and disbelieves.  
[Page 246, Line 40] 24. Allah will punish him with the greatest 
[Page 246, Line 41] punishment.  
[Page 246, Line 42] 25. To Us is their return.  
[Page 246, Line 43] 26. Then upon Us rests their reckoning.  

[Page 246, Line 45] 89. THE DAWN 
[Page 246, Line 46] (al-Fajr) 
[Page 246, Line 47] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 246, Line 48] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 246, Line 49] 1. By the daybreak.  
[Page 246, Line 50] 2. And ten nights.  
[Page 246, Line 51] 3. And the even and the odd.  
[Page 246, Line 52] 4. And the ni ght as it recedes.  
[Page 246, Line 53] 5. Is there in this an oath for a rational person?  
[Page 246, Line 54] 6. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt 
[Page 246, Line 55] with Aad?  
[Page 246, Line 56] 7. Erum of the pillars.  
[Page 246, Line 57] 8. The like of which was never created in the 
[Page 246, Line 58] land.  
[Page 246, Line 59] 9. And Thamood —those who carved the 
[Page 246, Line 60] rocks in the valley.  
[Page 246, Line 61] 10. And Pharaoh of the Stakes.  
[Page 246, Line 62] 11. Those who committed excesses in the 
[Page 246, Line 63] lands.  
[Page 246, Line 64] 12. And spread much corruption therein.  
[Page 246, Line 65] 13. So your Lord poured down upon them a 
[Page 246, Line 66] scourge of punishment.  
[Page 246, Line 67] 14. Your Lord is on the lookout.  
[Page 246, Line 68] 15. As for man, whenever his Lord tests him , 
[Page 246, Line 69] and honors him, and prospers him, he says, 
[Page 246, Line 70] “My Lord has honored me.”  
[Page 246, Line 71] 16. But whenever He tests him, and restricts 
[Page 246, Line 72] his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.”  
[Page 246, Line 73] 17. Not at all. But you do not honor the or-
[Page 246, Line 74] phan.  
[Page 246, Line 75] 18. And you do not urge the fee ding of the 
[Page 246, Line 76] poor.  
[Page 246, Line 77] 235 
[Page 247, Line 1] 90.  THE LAND  (al -Balad)  
[Page 247, Line 2] 19. And you devour inheritance with all greed.  
[Page 247, Line 3] 20. And you love wealth with immense love.  
[Page 247, Line 4] 21. No—when the earth is leveled, pounded, 
[Page 247, Line 5] and crushed.  
[Page 247, Line 6] 22. And your Lord comes, with the angels, row 
[Page 247, Line 7] after row.  
[Page 247, Line 8] 23. And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. 
[Page 247, Line 9] On that Day, man will remember, but how 
[Page 247, Line 10] will remembrance avail him?  
[Page 247, Line 11] 24. He will say, “If only I had forwarded for my 
[Page 247, Line 12] life.”  
[Page 247, Line 13] 25. On that Day, none will punish as He pun-
[Page 247, Line 14] ishes.  
[Page 247, Line 15] 26. And none will shackle as He shackles.  
[Page 247, Line 16] 27. But as for you, O tranquil soul.  
[Page 247, Line 17] 28. Return to your Lord, pleased and accepted.  
[Page 247, Line 18] 29. Enter among My servants.  
[Page 247, Line 19] 30. Enter My Paradise.  

[Page 247, Line 21] 90. THE LAND  
[Page 247, Line 22] (al-Balad ) 
[Page 247, Line 23] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 247, Line 24] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 247, Line 25] 1. I swear by this land.  
[Page 247, Line 26] 2. And you are a resident of this land.  
[Page 247, Line 27] 3. And by a father and what he fathered.  
[Page 247, Line 28] 4. We created man in distress.  
[Page 247, Line 29] 5. Does he think that no one has power over 
[Page 247, Line 30] him?  
[Page 247, Line 31] 6. He says, “I have used up so much money.”  
[Page 247, Line 32] 7. Does he think that no one sees him?  
[Page 247, Line 33] 8. Did We not give him two eyes?  
[Page 247, Line 34] 9. And a tongue, and two lips?  
[Page 247, Line 35] 10. And We showed him the two ways?  
[Page 247, Line 36] 11. But he did not brave the ascent.  
[Page 247, Line 37] 12. And what will explain to you what the as-
[Page 247, Line 38] cent is?  
[Page 247, Line 39] 13. The freeing of a slave.  14. Or the feeding on a day of hunger.  
[Page 247, Line 40] 15. An orphan near of kin.  
[Page 247, Line 41] 16. Or a destitute in the dust.  
[Page 247, Line 42] 17. Then he becomes of those who believe, and 
[Page 247, Line 43] advise one another to patience, and advise 
[Page 247, Line 44] one another to kindness.  
[Page 247, Line 45] 18. These are the people of happiness.  
[Page 247, Line 46] 19. But as for those who defy Our revela-
[Page 247, Line 47] tions —these are the people of misery.  
[Page 247, Line 48] 20. Upon them is a padlocked Fire.  

[Page 247, Line 50] 91. THE SUN  
[Page 247, Line 51] (ash-Shams ) 
[Page 247, Line 52] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 247, Line 53] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 247, Line 54] 1. By the sun and its radiance.  
[Page 247, Line 55] 2. And the moon as it follows it.  
[Page 247, Line 56] 3. And the day as it reveals it.  
[Page 247, Line 57] 4. And the night as it conceals it.  
[Page 247, Line 58] 5. And the sky and He who built it.  
[Page 247, Line 59] 6. And the earth and He who spread it.  
[Page 247, Line 60] 7. And the soul and He who proportioned it.  
[Page 247, Line 61] 8. And inspired it with its wickedness and its 
[Page 247, Line 62] righteousness.  
[Page 247, Line 63] 9. Successful is he who purifies it.  
[Page 247, Line 64] 10. Failing is he who corrupts it.  
[Page 247, Line 65] 11. Thamood denied in its pride.  
[Page 247, Line 66] 12. When it followed its most wicked.  
[Page 247, Line 67] 13. The messenger of Allah said to them, “This 
[Page 247, Line 68] is the she -camel of Allah, so let her drink.”  
[Page 247, Line 69] 14. But they called him a liar, and hamstrung 
[Page 247, Line 70] her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, 
[Page 247, Line 71] and leveled it.  
[Page 247, Line 72] 15. And He does not fear its sequel.  

[Page 247, Line 74] 92. THE NIGHT  
[Page 247, Line 75] (al-Layl) 
[Page 247, Line 76] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 247, Line 77] 236 
[Page 248, Line 1] 93.  MORNING LIGHT   (adh -Duha)  
[Page 248, Line 2] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 248, Line 3] 1. By the night as it covers.  
[Page 248, Line 4] 2. And the day as it reveals.  
[Page 248, Line 5] 3. And He who created the male and the fe-
[Page 248, Line 6] male.  
[Page 248, Line 7] 4. Your endeavors are indeed diverse.  
[Page 248, Line 8] 5. As for him who gives and is righteous.  
[Page 248, Line 9] 6. And confirms goodness.  
[Page 248, Line 10] 7. We will ease his way towards ease.  
[Page 248, Line 11] 8. But as for him who is stingy and compla-
[Page 248, Line 12] cent.  
[Page 248, Line 13] 9. And denies goodness.  
[Page 248, Line 14] 10. We will ease his way towards difficulty.  
[Page 248, Line 15] 11. And his money will not avail him when h e 
[Page 248, Line 16] plummets.  
[Page 248, Line 17] 12. It is upon Us to guide.  
[Page 248, Line 18] 13. And to Us belong the Last and the First.  
[Page 248, Line 19] 14. I have warned you of a Fierce Blaze.  
[Page 248, Line 20] 15. None will burn in it except the very wicked.  
[Page 248, Line 21] 16. He who denies and turns away.  
[Page 248, Line 22] 17. But the devout will avoid it.  
[Page 248, Line 23] 18. He who gives his money to become pure.  
[Page 248, Line 24] 19. Seeking no favor in return.  
[Page 248, Line 25] 20. Only seeking the acceptance of his Lord, 
[Page 248, Line 26] the Most High.  
[Page 248, Line 27] 21. And he will be satisfied.  

[Page 248, Line 29] 93. MORNING LIGHT  
[Page 248, Line 30] (adh-Duha ) 
[Page 248, Line 31] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 248, Line 32] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 248, Line 33] 1. By the morning light.  
[Page 248, Line 34] 2. And the night as it settles.  
[Page 248, Line 35] 3. Your Lord did not abandon you, nor did He 
[Page 248, Line 36] forget.  
[Page 248, Line 37] 4. The Hereafter is better for you than the 
[Page 248, Line 38] First.  5. And your Lord will give you, and you will 
[Page 248, Line 39] be satisfied.  
[Page 248, Line 40] 6. Did He not find you orphaned, and shel-
[Page 248, Line 41] tered you?  
[Page 248, Line 42] 7. And found you wandering, and guided you?  
[Page 248, Line 43] 8. And found you in need, and enriched you?  
[Page 248, Line 44] 9. Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan.  
[Page 248, Line 45] 10. Nor rebuff the seeker.  
[Page 248, Line 46] 11. But proclaim the blessings of your Lord.  

[Page 248, Line 48] 94. THE SOOTHING  
[Page 248, Line 49] (ash-Sharh ) 
[Page 248, Line 50] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 248, Line 51] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 248, Line 52] 1. Did We not soothe your heart?  
[Page 248, Line 53] 2. And lift from you your burden.  
[Page 248, Line 54] 3. Which weighed down your back?  
[Page 248, Line 55] 4. And raised for you your reputation?  
[Page 248, Line 56] 5. With hardship comes ease.  
[Page 248, Line 57] 6. With hardship comes ease.  
[Page 248, Line 58] 7. When your work is done, turn to devotion.  
[Page 248, Line 59] 8. And to your Lord turn for everything.  

[Page 248, Line 61] 95. THE FIG  
[Page 248, Line 62] (at-Tin) 
[Page 248, Line 63] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 248, Line 64] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 248, Line 65] 1. By the fig and the olive.  
[Page 248, Line 66] 2. And Mount Sinai.  
[Page 248, Line 67] 3. And this safe land.  
[Page 248, Line 68] 4. We created man in the best design.  
[Page 248, Line 69] 5. Then reduced him to the lowest of the low.  
[Page 248, Line 70] 6. Except those who believe and do righteous 
[Page 248, Line 71] deeds; for them is a reward without end.  
[Page 248, Line 72] 7. So why do you still reject the religion?  
[Page 248, Line 73] 8. Is Allah not the Wisest of the wise?  

[Page 248, Line 75] 237 
[Page 249, Line 1] 96.  CLOT   (al-’Alaq)  
[Page 249, Line 2] 96. CLOT  
[Page 249, Line 3] (al-’Alaq ) 
[Page 249, Line 4] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 249, Line 5] the Gracious, the M erciful  
[Page 249, Line 6] 1. Read: In the Name of your Lord who cre-
[Page 249, Line 7] ated.  
[Page 249, Line 8] 2. Created man from a clot.  
[Page 249, Line 9] 3. Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous.  
[Page 249, Line 10] 4. He who taught by the pen.  
[Page 249, Line 11] 5. Taught man what he never knew.  
[Page 249, Line 12] 6. In fact, man oversteps all bounds.  
[Page 249, Line 13] 7. When he considers himsel f exempt.  
[Page 249, Line 14] 8. But to your Lord is the return.  
[Page 249, Line 15] 9. Have you seen him who prevents?  
[Page 249, Line 16] 10. A servant when he prays?  
[Page 249, Line 17] 11. Do you think he is upon guidance?  
[Page 249, Line 18] 12. Or advocates righteousness?  
[Page 249, Line 19] 13. Do you see how he disbelieved and turned 
[Page 249, Line 20] away?  
[Page 249, Line 21] 14. Does he not know that Allah sees?  
[Page 249, Line 22] 15. No. If he does not desist, We will drag him 
[Page 249, Line 23] by the forelock.  
[Page 249, Line 24] 16. A deceitful, sinful forelock.  
[Page 249, Line 25] 17. Let him call on his gang.  
[Page 249, Line 26] 18. We will call the Guards.  
[Page 249, Line 27] 19. No, do not obey him; but kneel down, and 
[Page 249, Line 28] come near.  

[Page 249, Line 30] 97. DECREE 
[Page 249, Line 31] (al-Qadr ) 
[Page 249, Line 32] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 249, Line 33] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 249, Line 34] 1. We sent it down on the Night of Decree.  
[Page 249, Line 35] 2. But what will convey to you what the Night 
[Page 249, Line 36] of Decree is?  
[Page 249, Line 37] 3. The Night of Decree is better than a thou-
[Page 249, Line 38] sand months.  4. In it descend the angels and the Spirit, by 
[Page 249, Line 39] the lea ve of their Lord, with every command.  
[Page 249, Line 40] 5. Peace it is; until the rise of dawn.  

[Page 249, Line 42] 98. CLEAR EVIDENCE 
[Page 249, Line 43] (al-Bayyinah ) 
[Page 249, Line 44] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 249, Line 45] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 249, Line 46] 1. Those who disbelieved among the People of 
[Page 249, Line 47] the Scripture, and the Polytheists, were not 
[Page 249, Line 48] apar t, until the Clear Evidence came to them.  
[Page 249, Line 49] 2. A messenger from Allah reciting purified 
[Page 249, Line 50] scripts.  
[Page 249, Line 51] 3. In them are valuable writings.  
[Page 249, Line 52] 4. Those who were given the Scripture did not 
[Page 249, Line 53] splinter, except after the Clear Evidence came to them.  
[Page 249, Line 54] 5. They were commanded only to worship Al-
[Page 249, Line 55] lah, devoting their faith to Him alone, and to practice regular prayer, and to give alms. 
[Page 249, Line 56] That is the upright religion.  
[Page 249, Line 57] 6. Those who disbelieve among the People of 
[Page 249, Line 58] the Scripture, and the Polytheists, will be in 
[Page 249, Line 59] the Fire of Hell, where the y will abide forever. 
[Page 249, Line 60] These are the worst of creatures.  
[Page 249, Line 61] 7. As for those who believe and lead a right-
[Page 249, Line 62] eous life— these are the best of creatures.  
[Page 249, Line 63] 8. Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of 
[Page 249, Line 64] Eternity beneath which rivers flow, where 
[Page 249, Line 65] they will abide forever.  Allah is pleased with 
[Page 249, Line 66] them, and they are pleased with Him. That is 
[Page 249, Line 67] for whoever fears His Lord.  

[Page 249, Line 69] 99. THE QUAKE 
[Page 249, Line 70] (az-Zalzalah ) 
[Page 249, Line 71] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 249, Line 72] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 249, Line 73] 1. When the earth is shaken with its quake.  
[Page 249, Line 74] 2. And the earth brings out its loads.  
[Page 249, Line 75] 3. And man says, “What is the matter with it?”  
[Page 249, Line 76] 4. On that Day, it will tell its tales.  
[Page 249, Line 77] 238 
[Page 250, Line 1] 100.  THE RACERS   (al-’Adiyat)  
[Page 250, Line 2] 5. For your Lord will have inspired it.  
[Page 250, Line 3] 6. On that Day, the people will emerge in 
[Page 250, Line 4] droves, to be shown their works.  
[Page 250, Line 5] 7. Whoever has done an atom's weight of good 
[Page 250, Line 6] will see it.  
[Page 250, Line 7] 8. And whoever has done an atom's weight of 
[Page 250, Line 8] evil will see it.  

[Page 250, Line 10] 100. THE RACERS  
[Page 250, Line 11] (al-’Adiyat ) 
[Page 250, Line 12] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 250, Line 13] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 250, Line 14] 1. By the racers panting.  
[Page 250, Line 15] 2. Igniting sparks.  
[Page 250, Line 16] 3. Raiding at dawn.  
[Page 250, Line 17] 4. Raising clouds of dust.  
[Page 250, Line 18] 5. Storming into the midst.  
[Page 250, Line 19] 6. Indeed, the human being is ungrateful to his 
[Page 250, Line 20] Lord.  
[Page 250, Line 21] 7. And he bears witness to that.  
[Page 250, Line 22] 8. And he is fierce in his love of wealth.  
[Page 250, Line 23] 9. Does he not know? When the contents of 
[Page 250, Line 24] the graves are scattered around.  
[Page 250, Line 25] 10. And the contents of the hearts are ob-
[Page 250, Line 26] tained.  
[Page 250, Line 27] 11. Their Lord, on that Day, is fully informed 
[Page 250, Line 28] of them.  

[Page 250, Line 30] 101. THE SHOCKER  
[Page 250, Line 31] (al-Qari’ah ) 
[Page 250, Line 32] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 250, Line 33] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 250, Line 34] 1. The Shocker.  
[Page 250, Line 35] 2. What is the Shocker?  
[Page 250, Line 36] 3. What will explain to you what the Shocker 
[Page 250, Line 37] is? 
[Page 250, Line 38] 4. The Day when the people will be like scat-
[Page 250, Line 39] tered moths.  5. And the mountains will be like tufted wool.  
[Page 250, Line 40] 6. As for he whose scales are heavy.  
[Page 250, Line 41] 7. He will be in a pleasant life.  
[Page 250, Line 42] 8. But as for he whose scales are light.  
[Page 250, Line 43] 9. His home is the Abyss.  
[Page 250, Line 44] 10. Do you know what it is?  
[Page 250, Line 45] 11. A Raging Fire.  

[Page 250, Line 47] 102. ABUNDANCE  
[Page 250, Line 48] (at-Takathur ) 
[Page 250, Line 49] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 250, Line 50] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 250, Line 51] 1. Abundance distracts you.  
[Page 250, Line 52] 2. Until you visit the graveyards.  
[Page 250, Line 53] 3. Indeed, you will know.  
[Page 250, Line 54] 4. Certainly, you will know.  
[Page 250, Line 55] 5. If you knew with knowledge of certainty.  
[Page 250, Line 56] 6. You would see the Inferno.  
[Page 250, Line 57] 7. Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.  
[Page 250, Line 58] 8. Then, on that Day, you will be questioned 
[Page 250, Line 59] about the Bliss.  

[Page 250, Line 61] 103. TIME  
[Page 250, Line 62] (al-’Asr) 
[Page 250, Line 63] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 250, Line 64] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 250, Line 65] 1. By Time.  
[Page 250, Line 66] 2. The human bei ng is in loss.  
[Page 250, Line 67] 3. Except those who believe, and do good 
[Page 250, Line 68] works, and encourage truth, and recommend 
[Page 250, Line 69] patience.  

[Page 250, Line 71] 104. THE BACKBITER  
[Page 250, Line 72] (al-Humazah ) 
[Page 250, Line 73] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 250, Line 74] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 250, Line 75] 1. Woe to every slanderer backbiter.  
[Page 250, Line 76] 239 
[Page 251, Line 1] 105.  THE ELEPHANT   (al-Fil) 
[Page 251, Line 2] 2. Who gathers wealth and counts it over.  
[Page 251, Line 3] 3. Thinking that his wealth has made him im-
[Page 251, Line 4] mortal.  
[Page 251, Line 5] 4. By no means. He will be thrown into the 
[Page 251, Line 6] Crusher.  
[Page 251, Line 7] 5. And what will make you realize what the 
[Page 251, Line 8] Crusher is?  
[Page 251, Line 9] 6. Allah's kindled Fire.  
[Page 251, Line 10] 7. That laps to the hearts.  
[Page 251, Line 11] 8. It closes in on them.  
[Page 251, Line 12] 9. In extended columns.  

[Page 251, Line 14] 105. THE ELEPHANT  
[Page 251, Line 15] (al-Fil) 
[Page 251, Line 16] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 251, Line 17] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 251, Line 18] 1. Have you not considered how your Lord 
[Page 251, Line 19] dealt with the People of the Elephant?  
[Page 251, Line 20] 2. Did He not make their plan go wrong?  
[Page 251, Line 21] 3. He sent against them swarms of bir ds. 
[Page 251, Line 22] 4. Throwing at them rocks of baked clay.  
[Page 251, Line 23] 5. Leaving them like chewed -up leaves.  

[Page 251, Line 25] 106. QURAISH  
[Page 251, Line 26] (Quraysh ) 
[Page 251, Line 27] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 251, Line 28] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 251, Line 29] 1. For the security of Quraish.  
[Page 251, Line 30] 2. Their security during winter and summer 
[Page 251, Line 31] journeys.  
[Page 251, Line 32] 3. Let them w orship the Lord of this House.  
[Page 251, Line 33] 4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has 
[Page 251, Line 34] secured them against fear.  

[Page 251, Line 36] 107. ASSISTANCE  
[Page 251, Line 37] (al-Ma’un ) 
[Page 251, Line 38] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 251, Line 39] the Gracious, the Merciful  1. Have you considered him who denies the 
[Page 251, Line 40] religion?  
[Page 251, Line 41] 2. It is he who mistreats the orphan.  
[Page 251, Line 42] 3. And does not encourage the feeding of the 
[Page 251, Line 43] poor.  
[Page 251, Line 44] 4. So woe to those who pray.  
[Page 251, Line 45] 5. Those who are heedless of their prayers.  
[Page 251, Line 46] 6. Those who put on the appearance.  
[Page 251, Line 47] 7. And withhold the assistance.  

[Page 251, Line 49] 108. PLENTY  
[Page 251, Line 50] (al-Kawthar ) 
[Page 251, Line 51] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 251, Line 52] the Gracious, the Merciful

[Page 251, Line 54] 2. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.

[Page 251, Line 59] In the name of Allah,

[Page 251, Line 61] 1. Say, “O disbelievers.  
[Page 251, Line 62] 2. I do n ot worship what you worship.  
[Page 251, Line 63] 3. Nor do you worship what I worship.  
[Page 251, Line 64] 4. Nor do I serve what you serve.  
[Page 251, Line 65] 5. Nor do you serve what I serve.  
[Page 251, Line 66] 6. You have your way, and I have my way.”  

[Page 251, Line 68] 110. VICTORY  
[Page 251, Line 69] (an-Nasr)  
[Page 251, Line 70] In the name of Allah,  
[Page 251, Line 71] the Gracious, the Merciful  
[Page 251, Line 72] 1. When there comes Allah’s victory, and con-
[Page 251, Line 73] quest.  
[Page 251, Line 74] 2. And you see the people entering Allah’s re-
[Page 251, Line 75] ligion in multitudes.  
[Page 251, Line 76] 240 
[Page 252, Line 1] 111.  THORNS   (al-Masad )  
[Page 252, Line 2] 3. Then celebrate the praise of your Lord, and 
[Page 252, Line 3] seek His forgiveness. He is the Accepter of 
[Page 252, Line 4] Repentance.  

[Page 252, Line 6] 111. THORNS  
[Page 252, Line 7] (al-Masad )  
[Page 252, Line 8] In the name of Allah,

[Page 252, Line 14] 3. He will burn in a Flaming Fire.  
[Page 252, Line 15] 4. And his wife —the firewood carrier.  
[Page 252, Line 16] 5. Around her neck is a rope of thorns.  

[Page 252, Line 18] 112. MONOTHEISM  
[Page 252, Line 19] (al-Ikhlas )

[Page 252, Line 22] 1. Say, “He is Allah, the One.  
[Page 252, Line 23] 2. Allah, the Absolute.  
[Page 252, Line 24] 3. He begets not, nor was He begotten.  
[Page 252, Line 25] 4. And there is nothing comparable to Him.”

[Page 252, Line 35] ers. 
[Page 252, Line 36] 4. And from the evil of those who practice sor-
[Page 252, Line 37] cery.
